            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Shall doe no more, Chriſtian Reader, then is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually exſpected, if in the entrance unto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Meditations I give ſome briefe advertiſement touching the Author, &amp; the ſetting forth of this his Treatiſe which is here offered unto thee. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Author, it may be expedient for thee to know ſomewhat of his life who teacheth thee to conſider thine owne end. Doubtles he had learned to live well, and his good courſe of life may be alſo exemplary for ſtudious imitation, that could ſo well teach the art of dying. To ſay nothing of his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger but towardly dayes, giving great content and comfort to his pious parents &amp; friends; to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neither of his extraordinary piety &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in good learning, not onely in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-ſchooles, but alſo in the Vniverſity of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, where he was eſteemed for the moſt part to ſurpaſſe his contemporanies: that which I will onely touch upon, ſhalbe how he approoved himſelfe while he was imployed in the Lords Vineyard, into which he was timely ſent. After ſome few yeares ſpent in places of leſſe note, yet ſo as the learne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt &amp; godlieſt Preachers thereabout tooke notice of him &amp; embraced him with much love &amp; true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he was called to the miniſtery of the Church of Chriſt at Namptwich a famous towne in Cheſhire, about the yeare 1598. The extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence &amp; paines he tooke there, both in publick &amp; private, with perſons of all ſorts, and the bleſſed ſucceſſe, hath bene already witneſſed by the lively Epiſtles of Chriſt miniſtred by him, and ſhall more evidently appeare as a crowne of rejoycing unto him in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt at his comming. But when the times would not beare his continuance in that place where his labours were ſo profitable, where he was then ſo beloved, &amp; ſince that time ſo earneſtly deſired againe and longed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he followed the hand of Gods providence gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:14270:4"/>
him into the Netherlands, in the yeare 1605 The two firſt yeares he attended the Armie, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the word of grace unto the Regiments of our nation: and tooke ſuch paines in catechiſing the ſouldiers as well as preaching unto them, that their benefit and his comfort therein became greater then is ordinarily found in ſuch places. Then the Engliſh living at Amſterdam conformably unto the Dutch Reformed Church in the ſame city, whereof divers of them ſtood members, requeſting him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order to performe the office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour unto them, he hearkened unto that call of God, and was his chief inſtrument for the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; ſetling of that Church, wherein he did the worke of a faithfull ſhepheard above thirty yeares, untill age &amp; the infirmities thereof growing upon him the Magiſtrates of that city vouchſafed him the honour of an Emeritus, the favour that is wont to be given unto ſouldiers from their Prince in whoſe ſervice they have ſpent the ſtrength of their dayes. But ſhortly after, the Lord of the harveſt that had made him his labourer in that Vineyard &amp; crowned him with ſpeciall bleſſings upon his endeavours in the courſe of his paſtorall performances, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him by the meſſage of a lingring and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing diſtemper, ſometimes intermixed with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fits of the colick &amp; gravell, and ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with rheumes and catarrhes unto which he had bene long ſubject, did by the fiery chariot of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tertia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tranſport him unto the place of reſt, where he enjoyes the crowne of righteouſnes, layd up for them that have fought a good fight, finiſhed their courſe &amp; kept the faith. Among other graces and vertuous courſes adorning the hearts &amp; lives of Chriſtians, theſe two did moſt eminently ſhine in this faithfull ſervant of Chriſt; the one reſpecting his converſe with God, the other his communion with the Saints. The firſt was his exceeding delight in the Law of the Lord, apparent not onely in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:14270:4"/>
practiſe of thoſe dueties whereby the ſame is uſually manifeſted; but more eſpecially, firſt by his committing unto memory divers ſelect portions of H. Scripture, as moſt of the Pſalmes &amp; ſundry of the Epiſtles, in the original languages; wherein he tooke ſuch pleaſing paines, that ſometimes in the night ſeaſon alſo when he had any ſpare time from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reſt he would imploy it this way: ſecondly by his practiſe of that courſe which he doth more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once commend in the enſuing Treatiſe, in ſingling out ſundry of the choyceſt paſſages in the word of God, reducing them to their ſeverall heads, having them ever about him &amp; moſt conſtantly feeding upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the comforts thereof. The ſecond ſort of Chriſtian dueties wherein he excelled, was that which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the ſumme of the ſecond Table his love &amp; charity unto the fellow-members of Chriſt. The lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes of his diſpenſing to others in this kinde, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to his eſtate, will not eaſily be matched. I ſpare to mention the particulars, whereof the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his abode and the bowels of the poore Saints by him refreſhed (he withall drawing out his heart unto them as lovingly as men are wont to doe unto their familiars) are lively witneſſes. His ordinary diſcourſe, ſeaſoned with grace, alwayes profitable &amp; pleaſing, in ſpecial manner did affect the hearers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting much upon theſe two themes; firſt the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wiſedome, power &amp; goodnes of God ſhining in his creatures, even the leaſt of them, &amp; the many profitable leſſons which may be learned from them, whereabout he had many ſingular obſervations: and ſecondly the bleſſed condition of the Saints glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, touching which he had many divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſpeculations; &amp; towards his end ſpake ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually of theſe things &amp; what appertaines thereunto, that to them that were with him he ſeemed to be in heaven already, inſomuch as they wiſhed themſelves in the ſame way wherein he was carried on ſo cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. His ſufficiency &amp; abilities for the worke of
<pb facs="tcp:14270:5"/>
the miniſtery, wherein he laboured above fourty yeares; how mighty he was in the Scriptures, how ſkilfully profound in expounding difficult places, &amp; applying them to the benefit of ſoules; with what evidence and power his preaching wrought into the conſciences of his hearers; how cleerly and fully he could refute &amp; convince an adverſary of the trueth; how prudent and judicious he was in mannaging Church affaires, &amp; giving counſel &amp; adviſe in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſſes; theſe &amp; the like pearles ſhining in that crowne of paſtorall endowments wherewith he was qualifyed above many others, are abundantly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by thoſe that have bene moſt intereſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, doe in great meaſure appeare in what is here and elſwhere publiſhed, &amp; may be in like manner further manifeſted as occaſion ſerves, &amp; if need were could be confirmed by the teſtimonies of the learnedeſt of our age. For other maine helpes whereby men are fitted for the miniſtery, his ſkill was rare in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages that conduce unto the underſtanding of the Originall text of the Scriptures &amp; the ſeverall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters thereof. Beſides what is ordinarily required in this kinde, he could to good purpoſe &amp; with much eaſe make uſe of the Chaldean, Syriack, Rabbinicall, Thalmudicall, Arabick &amp; Perſian verſions &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries. Now whereas the ſtation which God had appointed unto him was for the chiefe &amp; latter part of his time at Amſterdam; yet (as the godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned have profeſſed) none hath more ſoundly oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that inſolent ſect for which that place hath bene ſo much reproached by many in our native country. Witneſſe his Arrow againſt the Separation of the Browniſts, which yet ſtickes in the ſides &amp; heart of their cauſe, though ſome impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their Schiſme, gnaw their tongues and ceaſe not to blaſpheme the Churches of Chriſt. If he had bene as forward to ſend forth what he had done in thoſe controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as they are to trouble the preſſe with their pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets; the world had ſeen at leaſt thrice ſo much as
<pb facs="tcp:14270:5"/>
it hath already of his paines in this kinde. As for the unhappy differences rayſed of later yeares in &amp; about the Church committed to his charge, what ever ſome have deemed, they that have bene rightly informed and impartially weighed what hath bene done, have approoved his wiſedome, faithfulnes &amp; uprightnes in the whole carriage of thoſe buſineſſes. We that have in great part bene privy to his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thoughts &amp; demeanour at thoſe times, have had aſſured evidence of the integrity of his heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which he hath alſo witneſſed unto the end. For the controverſies themſelves, God hath therein, greatly pleaded his cauſe ſundry wayes, both at the very time of their riſing &amp; ſince eſpecially. And as opportunity ſhall require, others may in due time behold what he hath done in defence of himſelfe &amp; the trueth againſt that which is publiſhed by others.</p>
            <p>But of thoſe and the like his paines in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: now ſomewhat muſt be ſayd of this Treatiſe which is here put into thy hands. It containes the ſumme of that which was delivered in divers ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to his owne flock in the yeare 1628. At the ſame time it was penned in ſuch manner as we found it after his deceaſe. Divers paſſages, eſpecially towards the end, were reſerved for ſecond thoughts, when he might returne to a further ſurvey. Though he had bene often importuned by others to publiſh theſe his Meditations; yet partly by his owne ſlownes to come abroad in that manner &amp; partly by the urgency of other occaſions their deſires could not then take place. But being moved againe when his end drew neere &amp; his weaknes would not ſuffer him to review it and perfect what was wanting, he was content I ſhould ſet it forth in ſuch manner as I could. Albeit I have had ſome trouble in bringing together what was ſcatteredly ſet downe, &amp; in ſome places exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into plaine words what was left in conciſe notes and ſhort intimations; yet I have purpoſely avoyded the adding of any thing that was not in the Authors
<pb facs="tcp:14270:6"/>
Manuſcripts, though I ſhould leave ſome abruptnes in the diſcourſe and harſhnes in the phraſe. I have onely adventured to ſet downe the contents at the beginning of every Chapter, ſo as thou mayeſt with eaſe poſſeſſe thy minde with the whole matter of it, &amp; readily turne unto what thou deſireſt. I need not here diſcourſe of the excellency &amp; uſefulnes of this Treatiſe. When thou haſt read it attentively &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, then judge whether the matter inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded be not carried along with all ſoundnes of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and demonſtration of the ſpirit of life &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; whether here be not pithily compriſed the ſumme of what the Scriptures afford of life &amp; death; whether moſt poynts of Chriſtian Religion be not here illuſtrated with ſome ſingular obſervations; and in a word, whether the whole doe not argue that he was a Scribe excellently inſtructed unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. The God of all grace &amp; glory make thee wiſe in cloſing thy thoughts with theſe Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; happy in the enjoyment of that bleſſed end unto which they give directions.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> How God calleth men to remember Death.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>How God is ſayd to wiſh, &amp; the efficacy of this wiſh. (a) Three Songs of Moſes, &amp; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of them to reach men their end. (b) in Paradiſe man called to remember death, before, in, &amp; after the fall. (c) The dayes of man ſhortened by halves at foure ſeverall times. (d) Why ſince Moſes his time they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at a ſtay. (e) The multitude of violent &amp; untimely deaths in the old world, the middle world, &amp; this laſt age of the world.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>O <hi>That they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end! Deu. 32.29.</hi> O what love and tender mercies doth the bleſſed God declare in this affectionate ſpeech concerning miſerable man! Though to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, God be without affections &amp; paſſions; for whatſorver he willes in heaven or in earth, that he doth, &amp; that he hath, <hi>Pſal. 115.3. 1. Chro. 29.</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:14270:8"/>
                  <hi>11.</hi> he needs not wiſh for any thing he wants: yet to ſhew us what we moſt wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, what we ſhould chiefly wiſh for, &amp; what moſt pleaſeth him in us; he ſpeakes as men, according to their ſenſe &amp; capacity. He uſeth a paſſionate phraſe of longing &amp; wiſhing, which in propriety of ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not with the Deity; to ſhew there is an unſpeakable matter in it, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per words cannot expreſſe to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and therefore ſtooping downe unto us, and as it were putting on our humanity, ſpeakes after the manner of men &amp; propoundes his wiſh, to ſhew thereby what is principally to be wiſhed for, and what men would deſire if they had the minde of God.</p>
               <p>Looke what reſpect God ſhewes for the keeping of all his Commandements, by wiſhing men had a heart to obſerve them alwayes, <hi>Deut. 5.29.</hi> ſuch reſpect he ſheweth, &amp; by the like wiſh expreſſeth for the remembrance of their latter end, as being the way &amp; meanes to bring them to a more diligent obſervation of them all.</p>
               <p>He ſayth not ſimply, Oh that they would thinke on their end: but withall he ſheweth their wiſedome &amp; happines
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14270:8"/>
if they hearken, by wiſhing <hi>that they vvere wiſe</hi> to doe it. And by ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of comming to be accounted wiſe in the ſight of God &amp; men, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to draw his people even unto all obedience, <hi>Deut. 4.6.7.8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is the Lord content to ſpeake once, but doubling &amp; trebling his words, with a loud voyce he calles them, to be wiſe, to underſtand, to conſider; as if he had ſayd, be wiſe, be wiſe, be wiſe; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, remember, remember your latter end. As the ſheet was thriſe let downe from heaven to ſhew the viſion more plainly, &amp; to imprint it more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the minde of Peter, <hi>Act. 10 16.</hi> ſo is the call of God inculcate upon Iſrael in this place. Neither is the act onely, but the object of this conſideration is likewiſe repeated and poynted at by the finger of God with a double demonſtrative, <hi>even this, their latter end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(a) Three ſpeciall Songs were written by Moſes the man of God; The maine argument of each of them is a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the latter end. The firſt at the red ſea &amp; entring into the wildernes ſhewes the latter end of their enemies, both from whence they came, Pharaoh
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14270:9"/>
&amp; the Egyptians periſhing in the waters; &amp; to whome they went, the Canaanites &amp; others melting away for feare; with the latter end of Jſrael to be planted in the mountaine of Gods inheritance. <hi>Exod. 15. 1-20.</hi> And this triumphant Song was heard againe from heaven, &amp; ſung by them that had got the victory of the beaſt, whereunto the remembrance of our end may bring us alſo, to rejoyce among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that have the harpes of God. <hi>Rev. 15.1.2.3.</hi> The ſecond Song ſhewes the vaine eſtate of all, the ſhortnes of this preſent life, how they haſten to their end, that all might number their dayes, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their hearts to wiſedome. <hi>Pſal. 90.</hi> This is probably ſuppoſed to have bene written when Iſrael being come to the borders of Canaan for their murmuring were turned back againe into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, till their carcaſſes were fallen, &amp; their dayes conſumed by the wrath of God. <hi>Numb. 13. &amp; 14.</hi> This third &amp; laſt was Moſes Swan-ſong, ſpoken &amp; written that ſelfe ſame day that he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to goe up &amp; dye in the mount Nebo, for his farewell when he had one foot in the wildernes &amp; an other in heaven. <hi>Deu. 32.48.49.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0.</hi> and is by many arguments
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14270:9"/>
commended unto us, both before it was ſet downe, <hi>Deut. 31.14-30.</hi> and in the preface, <hi>Chap. 32.1.2.</hi> and after at the concluſion of it, <hi>verſ. 46.47.</hi> And yet above all the ſentences of this Song, this ſtreyne eſpecially that calles us to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our latter end, is comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto us by the moſt earneſt wiſh of God himſelf. And therefore if either the wiſh of God, and ſuch a wiſh as is made for keeping all the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts together; or if the finding of true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; or if ſo many repetitions like ſo many knockes of the Lord upon our breaſt, be of any regard in our eyes, let us hereby conceive our owne blindenes &amp; negligence in this poynt: let us awaken at this loud call, and double &amp; treble our care in the remembrance of our latter end, to finde that comfort, which the Lord ſees is to be gotten thereby.</p>
               <p>(b) If we had no other call, ſuch a divine wiſh might ſuffice to make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our end. And what godly heart would not anſwer to this call &amp; ſay, Lord it is enough: I will never ceaſſe to thinke of my end? Yet the Lord ſees it is not enough, and therefore beſides this his wiſh, he calles againe an hundred wayes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14270:10"/>
by his word, his workes, his ordinances, &amp; proclaimes this leſſon, Remember your latter end. And firſt of all, Man was called of God even in paradiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his end before the fall. Death was ſet before his eyes in the Tree of Death, as well as life in the Tree of life. <hi>Gen. 2.17.</hi> The firſt day he was called to thinke on the laſt day. So ſoone as ſinne was forbidden, death was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, to keepe from ſinne; &amp; the tree of death was a viſible frontlet hung before the eyes of man to preſerve him in the feare of God. Jf in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, a law of mortality was made and a memoriall of death was needfull before it came; how much more in the ſtate of corruption when death is come into the world, &amp; walkes on every ſide, have we need now to remember it &amp; to watch?</p>
               <p>In the fall, while Evah yet ſtood ſhe reſiſted the temptation by remembring of the death that was threatned. <hi>Gen. 3.3.</hi> but when the ſerpent inſiſted &amp; removed the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of death out of her minde then ſhe fell. The voyce of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely dye, verſ. 4.</hi> they remembred not their latter end, &amp; came downe wonderfully. So the very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14270:10"/>
fall it ſelfe being on this manner, ſerves for an other Call to warne every one that would ſtand in the evill day, never to forget their latter end.</p>
               <p>After the fall, then God calles againe by a Sentence of mortality which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on man, <hi>Duſt thou art, &amp; to duſt thou ſhalt returne, Gen. 3.19.</hi> to make men with new care to thinke upon death. And this was a generall day of judgment in the beginning of the world, as there ſhall be an other Generall judgment in the end of the world. Then were we all in Adam &amp; Evah preſented before the Tribunall &amp; judgment-ſeat of God &amp; receyved the ſentence of the firſt death univerſally pronounced upon all men, righteous or unrighteous, elect or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; as there ſhal be a ſentence of ſecond death pronounced on the reprobate at laſt.</p>
               <p>After this Sentence, the Lord calles againe by the execution thereof from time to time, while death being entred into the world reignes among men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring all &amp; bringing all to duſt: yet ſo, that the execution of this Sentence is revealed in manifold &amp; diverſe degrees, according to the great patience &amp; long

their language, but cut of their dayes from foure or five hundred to two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred &amp; od yeares. <hi>Gen. 11.18-32.</hi> And ſo with the ruine of Babel, the life of man was ruinated. The lofty tower of mans age that before aſcended to ſo great an height by the ſteps of ſo many yeares, was now throwne downe &amp; made lower by the halfe. The noyſe &amp; craſh of this downefall ſounded through many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from Peleg to Terah, warning all to be more watchfull becauſe the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſentence of death with double ſpeed was brought upon them.</p>
               <p>After this in the time of Abraham &amp; the generations following, from two hundred &amp; od we finde the yeares of the Patriarkes brought to an hundred &amp; od. <hi>Gen. 25.7. &amp; 35.28. &amp; 47.28. &amp;c.</hi> So was the reprive of man ſhortned againe. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord called Abraham &amp; his ſeed into his covenant, he withall called both him &amp; the world by a new ſummo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as by ſound of trumpet, to repentance &amp; amendment of life by remembrance of their latter end, which now preſſed upon them with double haſt to that it had done.</p>
               <p>And laſtly in the time of Moſes the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14270:11"/>
Lord being provoked by a new rebellion did againe halfe the age of man &amp; redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the number of his yeares to ſeventy or eighty, <hi>Pſal. 90.10.</hi> Then was the execution of the Sentence of death haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more then ever before, &amp; thereby the Lord called them &amp; ſtill calleth us to remember our end. Lord let thy call be effectuall unto us: bring our hearts to true wiſedome; eſtabliſh thou the worke of our hands &amp; fill us with thy mercy in the morning that we may ſeeke thee early &amp; be glad in thee all our dayes.</p>
               <p>(d) If God ſhould once more have halfed the age of man as he did before, then can we not conceive how the world ſhould have ſubſiſted. If our dayes upon a new provocation had bene ſhortned from ſeventy to five &amp; thirty: if weaknes of old age had prevayled as much upon us at thirty, as now it doth at ſixty: if at fifteene yeares men ſhould have bene at their full ſtrength, &amp; then have begun to decline as now many doe at thirty, being then in the height &amp; vigour of their age, how manifold defects in learning &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have enſued? what wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; experience could men have learned in ſo ſhort a time? how could li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14270:12"/>
or mechanicall arts &amp; ſciences have bene learned, or what continuance of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth could have bene to have wrought &amp; exerciſed ſuch trades &amp; ſciences? what a world of children &amp; old folkes; yea what a world of fooles &amp; impotent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould we have had? though it be ſo already, yet how much more then? But the Lord will not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for ever, though he be now provoked as much as ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the ſpirit would faile before him, &amp; the ſoules that he hath made. <hi>Eſa. 57.16.</hi> Therefore hath the terme of mans age continued at this ſtay from Moſes to our time for about three thouſand yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo as it was never ſettled in the former generations. And therefore in ſpeciall is this worke of God to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of us, as being the laſt call &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God in this kinde, to make us remember our latter end.</p>
               <p>Now though God doe not againe ſhorten &amp; halfe the dayes of man by ſuch certaine &amp; determinate limits as formerly he hath done; yet after another manner he doth not ceaſſe to cut them off &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the courſe of nature for our warning as effectually as in the former judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For ſtill the Lord being provoked by the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14270:12"/>
wicked cutts them off before their time, they are brought downe to the pit, &amp; they live not out halfe their dayes, <hi>Pſal. 55.23.</hi> the number of their moneths is cut off in the middeſt. <hi>Iob, 21.21.</hi> as the vine ſhakes off his unripe grape &amp; the olive his flower, <hi>Iob, 15.33.</hi> And not the wicked alone, but the elect, the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God (as Henoch, <hi>Gen. 5.23.24.)</hi> are alſo taken away in the midſt of their dayes: though ſometime they live to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty or eighty yeares, &amp; come to their grave in a full age, as a ſhock of corne commeth in, in his ſeaſon, <hi>Iob, 5.26:</hi> yet oft they are taken away before, <hi>Eſa. 57.1.</hi> in infancy, childhood, youth, middle age, &amp;c.

               <p>(e) The multitude &amp; number of theſe uncertaine &amp; untimely deaths are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. We may obſerve it in three worlds. The old world periſhed all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

               </p>
               <p>(c) And this which hitherto we have heard of Angels, Magiſtrates, &amp; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is ſpoken of the good: come we now to ſpeake of the evill.

Who doth not ſee the axe layd unto the root of the tree in theſe dayes? both the bloody axe of warre, &amp; black axe of peſtilence, in ſome times &amp; places continued, in others threatned. Beſides, time it ſelfe is a ſythe, an axe: Night &amp; day are two axes at the root of our life, when one is up the other is downe, without reſt: every day a chip flyes away, and every night a chip; and ſo our bones ly ſcattered at the graves mouth, as when one cutteth or heweth wood on the earth. <hi>Pſalm 141.7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though every day giving us ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold examples of death do thereby ſerve to put us in minde thereof: yet in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner is the Sabbath-day ſet apart by the ordinance of God, that on it we ſhould conſider the latter end of man.

As the cartwheeles on the earth where they goe, leave a track or furrow behinde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſo the wheeles of theſe planets &amp; ſtars in their converſions make a deep impreſſion upon the earth, according to the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their motions: and ſome of them bring the ſpring, ſome the ſummer, ſome autumne, &amp; ſome duely draw on winter as with bands &amp; cords. <hi>Iob. 38.31.32. &amp; 9.9.</hi> This their operation is manifeſted in great variety, &amp; in ſuch manner that thereby they produce many new reall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles upon the earth. And from hence in divers flowers we have a plaine diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the houres in the day; while ſome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14270:21"/>
ſtill turne their face unto the Sunne, from the riſing to the ſetting, as Heliotropium or Turnſol; ſome declare the approch of the evening by ſhutting their flowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Dayſies, Marigold, Dandeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; others; ſome are ſo ſtrangely affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they ſhew it to be high noone by cloſing up themſelves juſt at that time, as we ſee dayly in the flower that is called Goates-beard or the ſtarre of Ieruſalem. Others againe diſtinguiſh the moneths of the yeare, ſome ſpringing &amp; flouriſhing in one moneth &amp; ſome in others ſucceſſively in order, as we ſee in the Primeroſe, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Roſe, Gilloflower &amp; others which follow even unto the winter moneths. Thus the pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the earth together with the planets of heaven become monitors of the time paſſing away.</p>
               <p>Neither is this to be obſerved in the plants onely, but in the ſenſitive creatures alſo, the fowles, fiſhes, &amp; fourefooted beaſts: the birds ſhew us the time of the day; ſome ſing at a certaine houre of the night before day; <hi>Mar, 13.35.</hi> ſome little birds at the day-break; <hi>Eccl. 12.4.</hi> ſome at noone, &amp; ſome nightbirds in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They diſtinguiſh alſo the times of the yeare; ſometimes revived, ſometimes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14270:21"/>
drooping and decaying againe in great variety. They know the times of their comming and going, ſome in one moneth and ſome in another, as the Stork, the Turtle, the Crane, and the Swallow. <hi>Iere. 8.7.</hi> and the fiſhes likewiſe have their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeaſons, as is dayly obſerved by the fiſhmongers. All theſe ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt them that know not the acceptable time, nor learn to redeeme it, though the Lord call them ſo many wayes, and ſhew them the time paſſing by ſo many deviſes.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HItherto we have heard the call of God ſounded out unto us in and by other creatures, by heaven and earth and the things therein that were made for man; now we are to conſider how God comes neerer unto man, and from the ſtate of mans owne perſon, calling, and condition, calles him by the ſight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to remember his latter end. And firſt, the Lord having made man of the duſt of the earth, <hi>Gen. 2.7.</hi> and thereupon after his fall ſhewed him his readines to return to duſt, <hi>Gen. 3.19. Eccl. 12.7.</hi> doth yet further call us to conſider our frailety by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14270:22"/>
ordaining that this houſe of clay is to be held upright by a puffe of the ayre conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually breathed in and out, and that this being ſtopt the houſe muſt preſently fall downe. Hereby our life hangs as it were looſe before us, going in and out every moment: therefore is it called the breath of life, <hi>Gen. 2.7. &amp; 7.15.22.</hi> our life being carried in &amp; out upon the breath, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon it. And as God tyed life to our body by ſuch a ſlender &amp; weake thread, ſo he calles us oft to mark it &amp; think on it &amp; to remember our mortall eſtate by the breath of our noſtrils ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departing. <hi>Eſa. 2.22. Pſa. 146.4. &amp; 104.29.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(a) An other fraile band of life, like unto our breathing, is the pulſe, which ariſeth from the heart &amp; the arteries or beating veines, &amp; this by a double motion of contraction &amp; dilatation, whereby they are drawne in &amp; out, both for the expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of noxious fumes through the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pores of the fleſh, &amp; for the drawing in of coole ayre to refreſh the heart &amp; to feed the vitall ſpirits. From the variety of the pulſe are taken many ſignes of health &amp; ſicknes, life &amp; death: it is the character of our ſtrength or weaknes, &amp;

are we provoked to watchfulnes.</p>
               <p>And as in the neceſſity of food, ſo in the quality thereof is our corruptible eſtate made evident unto us. Our food before it come into the body is diverſly prepared; and the principall fruits for nouriſhment of man &amp; comfort of his life, as corne, &amp; wine, &amp; figges, &amp; the like, are ripened &amp; made to grow more abundantly by the dung and excrements of beaſts caſt upon them: <hi>Luke. 13.8.</hi> from the juyce of the dung is the fatnes and ſweetnes of the fruits increaſed. And from hence is the ſtrength of our corruptible life: hence we may ſay to corruption, Thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As once the meat of the miſerable Iewes in their diſtreſſe was prepared with dung; <hi>Ezek. 4.12, 13.15.</hi> ſo is our food dayly in the growth of it, as it were ſeaſoned, baked, and concocted with dung. The earth accurſed for our ſinne is brought to this baſe condition that the fatteſt increaſe thereof is from excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and it yeeldeth fruit unto the mouth of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the tayle of the beaſts. After it is in the body a great part of it by the alteration there, is turned into corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and receyved into divers lothſome ſinkes and channels within the body till it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14270:23"/>
be againe expelled. By this periſhing food, <hi>Ioh. 6.27.</hi> God doth admoniſh us of our periſhing eſtate; &amp; ſhewes unto us, that meats are for the belly and the belly for meats, that he wlll deſtroy both it &amp; them. <hi>1. Cor. 6.13.</hi> Thus the ſtaffe of our ſtrength &amp; the very pillars of our life do carry in them the remembrance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction &amp; corruption for our warning.</p>
               <p>(c) But this is not all: Our food is not onely of corruption, but we feed even of death it ſelfe, &amp; that by the allowance of God, <hi>Gen. 9.3.</hi> in taking away the life of other creatures to maintaine our owne; eſpecially in theſe laſt times when he hath ſaid unto us of them all, Riſe, kill &amp; eat, <hi>Act. 10.13.</hi> Whatſoever is ſold in the ſha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that eat, aſking no queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake. 1 <hi>Cor. 10.25.</hi> herein we ſee death dayly preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to us &amp; ſet before us on our tables. This is ſeriouſly to be thought upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a wonderfull work of God: by the death of other creatures our life is preſerved: our living bodies are ſuſtaind by their dead carcaſſes: in their blood ſwimmes our life; and from their pangs of death ſpring the pleaſures of our life, our feaſts &amp; ordinary food. As the ſavage Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niballes eat the fleſh of men; ſo we eat the fleſh of beaſts that

that which any creature may ſerve to be a witneſſe of for convincing of ſinners, that doth the Lord declare to be their cry &amp; a denunciation of woe from them. <hi>Habac. 2.11. Iob. 31.38. Iam. 5.2.3.</hi> and in like manner that miſery which the creature enthralled by ſinne doth endure for man, that doth the Apoſtle expreſſely call their <hi>groaning and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together in paine vvith us, &amp;c. Rom. 8.22.</hi> Theſe groanes &amp; cryes are then eſpecially to ſound in our eares, while we are eating of them: as the Hare newly taken cries in the mouth of the grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound; ſo ſhould we be affected as if the ſame cry were made when we eat thereof, &amp; have their fleſh betwixt our teeth. The Gentleman that ſits at his table above in his dining chamber, and was not preſent in the kitchin or butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to ſee the execution, the convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of death, the ſprinting &amp; gaſping of the ſlaughtered creatures, is yet by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to repreſent the ſame and to make it preſent againe in his eating: for eating &amp; burying of them in our bellies is more then killing of them, &amp; a further meanes to ſtrike the heart with thought of death, procured for the eater. Our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14270:24"/>
ſtupidity &amp; blockiſhnes muſt needs be very great, if we conſider not this fearfull &amp; wonderfull providence of God: and we ſhall be worſe then the beaſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if we hearken not unto the call which God by them gives us, to awaken us out of our ſecurity, &amp; to make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our fraile condition.</p>
               <p>(d) An other helpe to preſerve our fraile bodies is our rayment and apparell which God hath given to cover and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the body without, as food within. And from hence we have a double or tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble memoriall of Death; conſidering that our apparell was then firſt given unto us, when by our ſinne we firſt came into the ſtate of death, &amp; not before, <hi>Gen. 2.25. with c. 3.7.</hi> And then when God firſt gave our garments unto us, he tooke them out of Deaths wardrobe, they being made with the death of the creatures from whence they were taken. God made coates of ſkinnes for Adam &amp; his wife &amp; his poſterity: <hi>Gen. 3.21. Heb. 11.37.</hi> The ſkins of the poore creatures were pluckt over their eares &amp; torne from their backes to cover the ſhame of our ſkinnes, &amp; to hide the nakednes of our hydes. And what was ſayd of Ioab in another caſe,

are ſwifter then a poſt, <hi>Iob. 9.25.</hi> that we ride poſt as on dromedaries that runne by the way in all haſt to their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end. And the travell that men have by ſea in the moſt ſwift ſhips is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of God to repreſent the ſwiftnes of our time that carries us night and day, ſleeping or waking to the haven of death. <hi>Iob 9.26.</hi> And according to this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and his example ſhould men make right uſe of other trades and their labours therein, to ſet their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end continually before their eyes thereby.</p>
               <p>(f) As labour &amp; toyle in the day, ſo ſleep &amp; reſt from labour in the night ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is alſo a neceſſary help to preſerve this mortall life. This ſleep is a lively image of death. For in ſleep men ly downe as dead men, without ſenſe and motion, ceaſſing from their workes and taking no knowledge of the things that are done by others: and therefore the holy Ghoſt often deſcribeth death by the name of ſleep, or lying downe to ſleepe. <hi>Geneſ. 47.30. Deuter. 31.16. 1. King. 2.10. Iob. 3.13. and ch. 14.12. Pſalm. 76.5. Matt. 27.52. Iohn. 11.11. Actes. 7.60. 1. Corinth. 11.30. 1. Theſſal.

4.13.</hi> By this marvellous work of God in breaking off the courſe of life, and making Sleepe like an Half-death to invade us continually, to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us like an unreſiſtable Giant eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day and to throw us downe; and then by his manner of ſpeech in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling death a Sleepe, he calleth us by conſideration of our ſleepe to conſider our death; &amp; by the ſight of our bed to remember our grave, to looke u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it as a Tombe or Sepulchre, &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night before we goe into it to labour for reconciliation with God, &amp; at the end of the day to ſeeke new ſenſe of his love in Chriſt as we would doe at the end of our life, that ſo we may lie downe &amp; ſleep ſafely.

                  <hi>7.8.9.</hi> but with the faythfull there is another remembrance of death by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, as comfortable to them, as the former is terrible to the wicked. For in ſight of ſinnes that greeve them they call to minde what ſhall quite free them from thoſe ſins; and what is that but death? Thereupon they ſet death before their eyes, and are taught of God ſo to doe, longing for their redemption, and deſiring to remoove out of the body, which is by death. <hi>Rom. 8.23. 2. Cor. 5.8.</hi> And how many wayes then is death propounded unto us? which way can we looke on the right hand or on the left, before us or behinde us, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way the memorialles of death are before us? Tranſgreſſions paſt, ſins preſent, feares of the wicked, deſires of the godly, all lead to the thought of death, and to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our latter end.</p>
               <p>(h) Againe the afflictions, ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; dangers, wherein death is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto men, are likewiſe meanes of death, and by them alſo we are called of God to remember our lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end. It pleaſeth God for the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſecure men, to bring men to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14270:26"/>
the gates of death before they enter: <hi>Pſal. 19.13.</hi> and though he bring them back againe, yet is this done of God for a memoriall of death. God brings men into ſuch extremity that they make full account to die, they receive the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death in themſelves, &amp; deſpaire of life, <hi>2. Cor. 1.8.9.</hi> and are free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead in their owne and others judgement; <hi>Pſal. 88.4.5.</hi> and this many times, they are in deaths often: <hi>2. Corint. 11.23.</hi> and ſuch things God worketh oftentimes, that men might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world, <hi>Iob. 33.22-29.</hi> and ſet their houſe in order, &amp; their heart in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to die, that being delivered they might then remember what thoughts &amp; deſires, what prayers &amp; purpoſes they had in their ſoules, and recall them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for their preparation againſt the time of their finall departure out of this world. <hi>Eſa. 38.1.15. &amp;c.</hi> As Iehoſaphat having cryed out in the danger of death, <hi>2. Chron. 18.31.</hi> was bound to remember that very cry and diſpoſition of his heart afterward: ſo foraſmuch as there is almoſt no man which hath not ſeene the face of Death and his dart ſhaken againſt him in

being pale, withered and wrinckled, &amp; the ſhadow of death ſitting upon their eye-lids; and ſome in divers degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both: and eſpecially in the ſight of friends long abſent and changed in that time, we are called to thinke how the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</p>
               <p>As the face ſo the ſtature of man gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing up as a plant, according to the divers meaſures and degrees of his growth appointed of God, <hi>Pſalm. 144. 12. Luk. 1.80. and 2.52.</hi> is another teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his changeable eſtate, even from the childe of a ſpan long unto thoſe that have their full growth. <hi>Lam. 2.20.</hi> Though ſome be of low ſtature, as Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus <hi>Luke. 19.3.</hi> and ſome againe higher then the common ſort by the head, as was Saul; <hi>1. Sam. 10.23.24.</hi> yet even in theſe compared with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the proportion of their growth is an evidence of their age to ſuch as know them. Though men being come to their full ſtature ſtand at a ſtay, and looſe not their ſtature by ſuch degrees as they attained unto it in their youth; yet many times we ſee in experience that crooked old age bowing downe their heads more &amp; more to the earthward,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14270:27"/>
they doe hereby after a ſort looſe their ſtature by degrees, &amp; grow into the ground againe. And thus the wheele of mans age viſibly &amp; ſenſibly turning about according to the variation of his ſtature is another admonition to remember the latter end approching.</p>
               <p>(k) Beſide the face &amp; ſtature, the Lord hath ſet ſundry other markes upon the bodies of young and old, for memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of their time paſſing away at the changes of their age. The younger peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have the time of love deſcribed of God by divers markes and tokens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>Ezech. 16.7.8.</hi> but eſpecially old age hath the tokens of neere-approching death imprinted upon them, whereby they are warned of God to prepare for it. The decay of ſtrength, the decay of ſenſe, the decay of health, are all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of death, and ſummon them to their end. Through decay of ſtrength the armes and hands, the keepers of the houſe, beginne to tremble. <hi>Eccleſi. 12.3.</hi> and the legges that are as pillars thereof do bow themſelves; and the help of a ſtaffe as a third legge to reſt on, is ſought of the aged perſon, <hi>Zach. 8.4.</hi> and with that woodden legge at
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14270:28"/>
every ſtep he goes, he ſtrikes upon the earth &amp; raps at the gate of the grave, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be opened unto him. By this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes death comes &amp; puts his manicles upon their hands, &amp; his ſhackels upon their legges, for remembrance of their end. This weaknes is further ſignifyed by the ceaſſing of the grinders in the mill, <hi>Eccleſ. 12.3.</hi> both the upper &amp; the nether milſtone, which are called the life of man; <hi>Deut. 24.6.</hi> Theſe teeth fayling, life begins to fayle. From this weaknes the doores of the lips are ſhut without, the ſound of the grinding is low, &amp; the voyce hoarſe: and ſo whether the old per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons worke with their hands, or walke with their feet, or eate with their teeth, or ſpeake with their lips, the memoriall of death is in each of theſe ſet before them. And as in the outward parts of the body, ſo the like weaknes &amp; decay of ſtrength is to be obſerved in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and as a cauſe of that which is in the outward. The ſilver coards of the ſinewes, which carry the faculty of ſenſe &amp; motion from the head, in old age are looſed: <hi>Eccleſ. 12.6.</hi> that cable of the marrow in the backbone, which was wont ſo firmely to hold &amp; ſtay the fraile
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14270:28"/>
barke of our body toſſed with ſo many motions, and by thoſe many conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nerves like ſo many paire of oares on each ſide did row the gally up and downe, begins now to diſſolve. The head which is the golden bowle, wherein is emboxed the brayne that miniſters that faculty of ſenſe &amp; motion, through age is broken &amp; becomes crazie. The many pitchers of the veines, which carry the nouriſhing blood from the well of the liver unto each part of the body, become like unto broken veſſels. And the wheele of the arteries, which by the reciprocall motions &amp; pulſes doe convey the vitall ſpirits from the ciſterne of the heart into the furtheſt coaſts of the little world, for the quickening of the whole fleſh, even to the toes &amp; fingers ends, through lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing age begins to turne &amp; returne ſlowly &amp; weakely. And all theſe faint operations are ſo many memorials of death, and doe plainely portend the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of our latter end, &amp; every one of them admoniſheth us to watch. Againe from this weaknes &amp; decay of ſtrength both in the outward and inward parts, ariſeth an other memoriall of death, to be ſeene in that which is eſteemed no

Old age is many times a continuall ſicknes, &amp; when the dayes of man are multiplyed, they are but labour &amp; ſorrow, even the ſtrength of them. <hi>Pſa. 90.10.</hi> Then is the time when the evill dayes approch, and the yeares of which man ſayth, I have no pleaſure in them. <hi>Eccle. 12.1.</hi> Then is the light of Sunne, Moone, &amp; ſtarres obſcured: and then the clouds returne after the raine;

one infirmity after another. <hi>v. 2.</hi> Through decay of naturall heat ariſeth indigeſtion &amp; crudity of ſtomack, &amp; thereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low rheumes, &amp; catarrhes; and from thence comes ach in the bones, &amp; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold paines &amp; diſeaſes, whereby the Lord as with an yron pen writeth our leſſon, &amp; engraveth this ſentence deep in our fleſh &amp; bones, Remember your latter end approaching. In all the paines of old age the finger of God nippeth &amp; pincheth men, to make them think of his call &amp; prepare for death.</p>

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:14270:30"/>upon. God ſhewes that then he exſpects a ſpeciall act of humiliation, when at our end he viſites us with ſuch paines; that we are to mourne for ſinnes committed in the world before we depart out of it, when he ſends ſuch ſorrow unto us at that time eſpecially. Then are we called to ſtirre up the grace of God within us, and to rayſe up our ſpirits with all love &amp; reverence to meet the Lord, that we may receyve his bleſſing, and enter into his gates with joy &amp; into his courts with thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>(a) Againe this paine prevayling at the approch of death, cauſeth men to ly downe &amp; to fall flat along upon their beds, <hi>Iob. 33.19. Act. 5.15.</hi> and to let all the affaires of the world alone, with the works of their calling. Through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the body God forceth them to ſtoope, &amp; calleth them to remember their frailety &amp; their end; as if he ſhould command them to couch downe before him, and require them to proſtrate their ſoules at his footſtoole in ſeeking his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour &amp; mercy in Chirſt, even as their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are proſtrate by his hand. This very poſition of the body repreſents unto us how the graſſe withers &amp; the flower falls,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14270:30"/>
and admoniſheth us in our ſoules to worſhip &amp; fall downe before the Lord our maker; and by faith to enforce our bodies alſo leaning on our ſtaffe, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon the beds head, <hi>Heb. 11.21. Gen. 47.31. and 48.2.</hi> that he may ſtraightway lift us up for ever. As Iacob bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ground ſeven times, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of his brother Eſaw: <hi>Gen. 33.3.</hi> ſo the Lord himſelfe by ſicknes thruſts us downe ſeven times; we are often up &amp; downe; we lift up our ſelves, but cannot hold up our heads: God teacheth us there by to come ſubmiſſively creeping into his preſence, &amp; humbling ourſelves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt us. <hi>1. Pet. 5.6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(b) An other warning to thinke of the end at hand, is that diſtaſt of meat and want of appetite in ſick perſons; when their life abhorreth bread, &amp; their ſoule dainty meat. <hi>Iob. 33.20.</hi> When the ſtaffe of bread failes &amp; the ſtay of naturall life is withdrawne, then God calles the ſick perſons to remember their end, to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their care for eternal life, to ſeeke the hidden manna, unknowne &amp; unregarded of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. to feed upon the bread of God which commeth downe

for their end. This yron ſleep is a black cloud of death, a night-ſhade &amp; a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular darkenes, of which in its meaſure is verifyed that more generall ſaying of our Saviour, The night comes, when no man can work: <hi>Ioh. 9.4.</hi> and therefore while there is light &amp; liberty of minde in the time of health, the end is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred &amp; provided for, before the houres of oppreſſion doe come upon the minde.</p>
               <p>(e) Sometimes in ſicknes, though ſleep oppreſſe not, there is a kinde of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſtraction, cauſed by phrenſie, or melancholy, or other diſtemperatures, which doth overwhelme the minde, as Nebuchadnezzars once was by the ſtroke of God, <hi>Dan. 4.</hi> ſo that it is unfit to thinke of death, or to ſeeke any comfort againſt the danger thereof. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth likewiſe appeare how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are that deferre the time of their repentance unto the time of death, when it is uncertaine whether they ſhall be maſters of their owne wits, &amp; naturall underſtanding, not to ſpeake of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall grace which is further above the reach of man, &amp; yet neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>(f) Sometimes the very vehemency
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14270:31"/>
&amp; extremity of paine doth trouble &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe the minde, and diſables it that it cannot orderly &amp; quietly diſpoſe it ſelfe unto godly &amp; comfortable meditations; but being overcome with impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce frets &amp; murmures &amp; is toſſed up &amp; downe without fruit. Therefore are theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of anguiſh compared to a cup of intoxicating wine, making men as it were drunken with greefe, <hi>Eſa. 51.17. 21.22. Lam 4.21.</hi> and even mad with woe &amp; ſorrow, that they know not what to doe. <hi>Deut. 28.34. Ier. 25.16. Eccleſ.</hi> 7.7. And what folly is it then for men to be unprepared through forgetfulnes of their latter end, &amp; to remaine drunken with ſecurity all their life till they be drowned in a gulfe of miſery? Perplexity &amp; extreme anguiſh may juſtly come as a ſnare upon them that abuſe their preſent peace &amp; eaſe, promiſing themſelves li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty &amp; power to diſpatch all that is needfull for their ſalvation in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their laſt diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>(g) And commonly when death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth, our adverſary the devill, that prince of darknes, that hath gone about as a roaring lyon watching to devoure us at all opportunities before, doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

Experience ſhewes what great temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s many have undergone upon their death-bed. And therfore the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this laſt great combat ſhould warne every one betimes to arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, to gather ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth every day againſt the laſt day, to furniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves with grace, to ſeek truth &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, faith &amp; patience, ſtore of comfortable promiſes out of the word of God layd up in their hearts &amp; kept in readines, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh themſelves in hope, to watch &amp; pray unceſſantly; that having concluded this laſt combat &amp; obtained the victory, they may then be tranſlated from a ſtate mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to a ſtate triumphant for ever.</p>

               <p>THeſe forewarnings are ſuch as ſerve chiefly for the inſtruction of thoſe that feele them, &amp; on whoſe perſons they are inflicted: but beſide theſe forewarnings the dead leave unto the living many after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14270:32"/>
of their mortality, which admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſucceeding generation that they muſt follow their praedeceſſours. And here firſt of all obſerve, how it is ordered by divine providence, that in death the ſoule &amp; body be ſeparated one from the other. In this ſeparation the Soule is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away inviſibly; no man knoweth how nor whither. No humane ſenſe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcerne the ſpirit of man aſcending. <hi>Ecc. 3.21.</hi> The Lord in his unſearchable counſell would have the opening of the gates of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond world to be kept ſecret &amp; cloſe from us. If godly parents ſhould ſee the ſoules of their children carried away to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the clawes of an helliſh dragon, &amp; crying unto them with a lamentable and deſperate voyce, what horrour &amp; woe would this be unto them, to make their dayes more uncomfortable ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they ſhould live on earth? God in great mercy conceales it from them. If wicked &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men ſhould ſee their children or companions ſoules haled away by evill ſpirits after they were ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their bodies, &amp; withall ſhould heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhrike &amp; cry &amp; curſe their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, what a ſtroke of terrour might this be unto them? but God in juſtice hides theſe things from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

&amp; will not ſatiſfy the curioſity of profane men, that deſpiſe his Goſpell and the means of life revealed therein. This ſecret manner of tranſlating the ſeparated ſoules in carrying ſome cloſe priſoners to Hell, and tranſporting others in covered wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons &amp; inviſible chariots unto Glory, ſerves to warne and admoniſh us by the very forme thereof, ſo much the more to remember the other evident monuments of our frailety. When ſecret things are reſtrayned to the Lord, the things revealed are immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the more enforced upon us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame. <hi>Deut. 29.29.</hi> When the Spirit recordes how ſome perſons, men or angels, have vaniſhed out of the ſight of thoſe they had ſpoken withall, we are to obſerve how they were occaſioned thereby to thinke the more of that which they had ſeene &amp; heard from ſuch, and not to prye into that which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from them. <hi>Luke, 24.31.32. Act. 8.39. Iudg. 6.21.22. &amp;c.</hi> Yea the Lord appointed that they ſhould not be ſuffered to live, which went about to talke with the dead ſoule or to rayſe the ſpirits. <hi>Levit. 20.27. 1. Sam. 28.8 9. &amp;c.</hi> But by all this we are ſo much the more
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14270:33"/>
led to obſerve the common viſible me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of mortality ſhewed unto us in them that die before us.</p>
               <p>(i) It is further to be obſerved, that when the ſpirit is carried away preſently to God that gave it, yet the body remains behinde &amp; returnes to duſt from whence it came. <hi>Eccleſ. 12.7.</hi> If God by death had taken away both the ſoule &amp; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together at the ſame time; if it had pleaſed God to take away all men as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch &amp; Elias were; <hi>Heb. 11.5. Gen. 5.24. 2. Kin. 2.11.17.</hi> or to bury all men ſo as Moſes was, <hi>Deut. 34.6.</hi> namely ſo that their bodies ſhould be ſeene no more among men; yet even then, there were cauſe enough to remember that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full great &amp; finall tranſlation: but now ſeing every man departing this life leaves a peece of himſelfe among his friends on earth, yea the one halfe of his perſon, and that halfe which is the viſible part, even the body that was beſt knowne among men; the Lord by this fragment of man that is left, gives us occaſion to thinke what is done with the reſt, and to keepe in memory the death paſt, to prepare us for death to come. As Elias aſcending to heaven let his mantle fall, for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:14270:34"/>
ſo much care for our bodies as we doe for the ſoules; according to this example of God, who ſhewes more love &amp; reſpect to the ſoules, taking them firſt into his heavenly Kingdome &amp; glory, when as he ſuffers the body ſo long a time after, to lodge in diſhonour, &amp; to remaine in the pit of corruption. <hi>1. Cor. 15.43.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(l) The ſequeſtration of the body from the place where the ſoule is, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it being ſeparate, are memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles wrought immediately by Gods owne hand: beſide theſe there are other after-warnings of death effected by the providence of God mediately by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of men, that ſeeke the honour of the dead &amp; comfort of the living. For honour of the dead, holy men of old have ſhewed great care to provide ſepulchers, tombes, &amp; monuments for them. Such were the cave of Machpelah purchaſed by Abraham; <hi>Gen. 40.30.31. and 23.</hi> the pillar on Rachels grave that Iaakob ſet up, <hi>Gen. 35.20.</hi> that continued ſo many generations to Samuels time; <hi>1. Sam. 10.2.</hi> the title on the ſepulcher of the man of God, that propheſied of Ioſias; <hi>2. Kin. 23.17.18.</hi> the ſepulcher of David, that continued twiſe fourteene generations,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14270:34"/>
from David to the Apoſtles time, <hi>Act. 2.29.</hi> having bene preſerved in the time of the Babylonian captivity, even then when both city &amp; temple were deſtroyed, with many the like. Theſe monuments are in Scripture called <hi>Memorialles, Mnemeia, Matth. 23.29. Iohn. 11.38. and 19.41. and 20 1.</hi> by which (whatſoever others intended) the godly are taught to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their latter end. The garniſhed tombes and the ſumptuous ſepulchers are but ſo many ſcaffolds, ſtages &amp; theaters of humane frailety, and ſo many pulpits out of which our mortality is preached: and all the common graves of the people are the coffers of death, the ſight whereof ſhould teach us to lay up our treaſure in heaven. And thus, though the touch of a grave defiled the body with a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall pollution in the time of the Law; <hi>Numb. 19.16.</hi> yet the ſight of a grave may ſerve to cleanſe the ſoule by a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſideration of our end, even as the ſight of the Leviathan raiſed up, did bring men to purify themſelves, fearing leſt the whale might be their grave. <hi>Iob. 41.25. with Iob, 3.8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(m) The grave being prepared for the dead corps, then men proceed with their
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>

may obtaine.</p>
               <p>(n) Having bene at the grave &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the laſt duety to the perſon of the dead, we then returne &amp; come from the dead to the living, to the friends of the dead, to mourne with them, to comfort them, and (as the kinred &amp; ſpeciall friends of old uſed) to eat &amp; drink with them &amp; give them the cup of conſolation: <hi>Rom. 12.15. Ier. 16.7.8. Gen. 37.35. 1. Chro. 7.22. Ioh. 11.19.</hi> and in this action we have an other call to remember our end. While we miniſter conſolation to others, we are to take an exhortation to our ſelves. The houſe of mourning is the ſchoole of mortification; and therefore better to enter into it then into the houſe of feaſting: for there is the end of all men, which the living will lay unto his heart, &amp; ſo be made better in his heart by the conſideration of the dead &amp; by the ſadnes of the countenances waiting on that conſideration. <hi>Eccleſ. 7.2.3.4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(o) When the comforters of them that mourne are departed from the mourning houſe &amp; gone every one to his owne; yet ſtill the friends of the dead, even while they live on earth, ſo often as they miſſe their friends departed, &amp; want the help
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14270:35"/>
&amp; benefit which they were wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy from them, ſo often are they called to remember death, that makes ſuch ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. <hi>La. 4.18-20.</hi> The widowes, orphanes, deſolate parents, oppreſſed ſubjects, &amp; ſcattered ſheep, that are deprived of their loving huſbands, parents, children, rulers, paſtours, or any friend &amp; neighbour that miſſeth the company of an other, are by this want called to remember both that death paſt which took away their friends, &amp; that death to come which ſhall againe reſtore them &amp; bring them together. <hi>1. Theſſ. 4.13.14. 2. Sam. 12.23.</hi> And in this remembrance they are withal warned to make themſelves ready for death, &amp; not to be glewed unto this world from whence their comforts are taken away. When the ſhepheard takes up the young lamb, the ewe followes him of her ſelfe, and needs no more calling or driving: when the great ſhepheard of the ſheep takes away the ſoules of young &amp; old, &amp; of deareſt friends from one another, it is to make them runne after the Lord &amp; to long after his preſence, in whom they ſhall finde all &amp; more then all that ever they loſt in this world.

               <p>(a) The laſt end of the godly is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. This life conſiſts eſpecially in fellowſhip with God &amp; the Saints. By fellowſhip with God men come to ſee

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the communion which man had with God, being created after his likeneſſe. (a) The image of God in the ſoule, though perfectly beautifull &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, (b) yet inferiour to the image of Chriſt in the faithfull, the perfection &amp; perpetuity thereof in the world to come. (c) The body at firſt though naked, yet without ſhame &amp; pain, erect &amp; upright,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14270:41"/>
in all the ſenſes fitted for communion with God; (d) but hereafter endued with more noble &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly qualities, ſpirituall, tranſparent, light, agile, ever vigilant in feeing &amp; communicating with God. (e) The dominion over the creatures given at firſt, illuſtrated by the remnants thereof yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. (f) not to be compared with that which ſhall be, in regard of heaven &amp; earth &amp; all that is therein.</p>
                  <p>Of their mutuall fellowſhip with one another. (g) Marriage the firſt band of ſociety &amp; ground of all other, &amp; to that end inſtituted &amp; honoured of God for their mutual comfort: (h) yet nothing like the glorious bands of communion with Saints &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven. (i) What bleſſed communion A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; Evah might have had with their poſterity living to this day, if neither had ſinned: (k) In a right line deſcendent viewing the long race of their progeny, with great joy to themſelves, (l) and no leſſe happines to their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who though living at greateſt diſtance, might then with eaſe, &amp; abundance of comfort have viſited them and communicated with them: (m) In the collaterall line extended on each ſide to brethren &amp; ſiſters, all rejoycing in one another, in their loving, eaſy &amp; pleaſant viſitations: (n) Yet all this comes ſhort of the heavenly communion in the world to come, the love of Chriſt, the manifold rivolets of ſweet fellowſhip, the free &amp; glorious motions in the kingdome of heaven.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat we may the better comprehend that happy communion, wherewith the latter end of the faythfull ſhall be glorifyed, let us ſomewhile leave our ſpeech of the world to come, as alſo of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14270:42"/>
this preſent world, and let us looke back into the world that is gone &amp; paſt; let us behold the glory that is loſt, that by the greatnes thereof firſt conſidered in it ſelfe &amp; then compared with this to come, the glory hereof may more evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. That we may the better obſerve the difference, we are to ſet ourſelves as it were in a middle gate betwixt two worlds, the old and the new, where we may have an open and free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect into them both; and from thence we are to caſt a look firſt into the old world, then into the new; with one eye to behold the firſt paradiſe in Eden, and with another the ſecond paradiſe in the third heavens; with one look to view the firſt Adam, his gifts &amp; his children, and with an other look to behold the ſecond Adam, Chriſt Ieſus, his gifts &amp; his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo to compare the glory of their eſtates together. In ſuch a middle gate or tower of proſpect into theſe two worlds, the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſet themſelves when they compared them together, as appeareth in thoſe texts, <hi>Old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new. 2. Cor. 5.17. Behold I create new heavens &amp; a new earth: and the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14270:42"/>
former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into my minde. Eſa. 65.17. The firſt man A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam vvas made a living ſoule, the laſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam vvas made a quickening ſpirit. 1. Cor. 15.45. ſo v. 49. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(a) The glory of the old world in the primitive eſtate thereof, conſiſted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in a bleſſed fellowſhip with God and fellowſhip with men. This bleſſed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of God with man appeared firſt in that he communicated his image and ſimilitude with man, the beauty of which image ſhined eſpecially in that wiſedome holines &amp; righteouſnes, which God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the ſoule. <hi>Gen. 1.26.27. with Eph. 4.24. Coll. 3.10. Eccl.</hi> 7.29. By that wiſedome he knew God &amp; ſaw his glory, by that holines he did cleave unto him &amp; embrace him with love, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; confidence, and ſo in both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with God. At the beſtowing of this image, each Perſon in the holy Trinity did work together, &amp; each gave precious &amp; excellent gifts unto man, for the beautifying of his ſoule with variety of graces, ſuch as might make him a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creature, in whom the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might take delight: <hi>Rev. 4.10.11. with Ioh. 1.3. Coll. 1.16. Iob, 33.4.</hi> and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14270:43"/>
therefore is the Trinity deſcribed conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about this work, <hi>Let us make man in our image, after our likenes;</hi> all are noted with the title of creatours or makers, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.1. <hi>boreêcha. Iob. 35.10. ghnoſai.</hi> As upon the loſſe of this image, when Adam begate a ſonne in his owne likenes, <hi>Gen. 5.3.</hi> all hatefull &amp; ugly deformity of ſin ſucceeded &amp; every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onely evill continually: <hi>Gen. 6.5.</hi> ſo had he reteyned the image of God, every imagination of the thoughts of his heart ſhould have bene onely good and gracious continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, without any inclination to evill or the leaſt looking awry to any thing that might have bene diſpleaſant in the ſight of God. And this image of God had bene ſuch a beauty as the eye of man never ſaw in this corrupt world; ſuch a perfect beauty, ſuch a ſymmetry &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of grace as that Gods owne judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious eye ſhould have found no fault or diſlike in it.</p>
               <p>(b) And yet even this perfect beauty given at the firſt creation, was farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and not to be compared with the glory of the world to come: even that which was made glorious had no glory
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14270:43"/>
in this reſpect, by reaſon of that which excelleth. <hi>2. Cor. 3.10.</hi> The firſt man is of the earth earthly, though made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet in a lower degree of perfection: the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthly, ſuch are they that be earthly; and as is the heavenly, ſuch are they that be heavenly. As we have borne the image of the earthly, we ſhall alſo beare the image of the heavenly, <hi>1. Cor. 15.47.48.49.</hi> and ſhall be made conforme to the image of the Sonne of God: <hi>Rom. 8.29.</hi> and that pleaſant image of Chriſt is the higheſt degree of perfection, the ſweeteſt mirrour of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in heaven or earth, ſtayning the glory of the former image. The innocency of Adam was a white robe &amp; a glorious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament unto him; but the righteouſnes of God in Chriſt is a white robe more pure &amp; precious, of a finer threed, of a brighter white, of a more divine faſhion to adorne the ſoule; and by that righteouſnes put on, the Lord himſelfe becomes a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme of beauty unto his people, <hi>Eſa. 28.5. &amp; 62.3.</hi> Kings uſe to give gifts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtate of kings, great, &amp; royall; <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2.18. and ſo did the heavenly King at the firſt creation: but the

Now both the ſhame &amp; paine of nakednes is very great; <hi>Eſa. 20.4. 2. Sam. 10.4.5. Reu. 3.18. &amp; 16.15. 1. Cor. 4.11. 2. Cor. 11.27.</hi> and ſuch that men ſtrive to cover the whole body ſo farre as neceſſity will permit, the hands &amp; face being therefore excepted; the face left uncovered, leſt the eyes ſhould be blindfold &amp; the breath ſtopt; &amp; the hands leſt the manifold works of man in his divers callings ſhould be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and yet even they alſo ſo muffled ſometimes with maſkes &amp; muffes &amp; mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, that with great cumber &amp; trouble they are often in the day covered &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered &amp; covered againe to avoyd the injury of the weather. A great freedome it was to have bene without care what to put on; when as they needed no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations as are ſince given to us therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. <hi>Matth. 6.25.31.</hi> Againe the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall forme of mans body erect &amp; upright with his face upward, whereas other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are made with their heads hanging
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14270:44"/>
downward &amp; with their faces prone to the earth, doth ſhew that man is called to fellowſhip with the Lord dwelling on high. As the Lord when he ſtill exhorts us to lift up our eyes &amp; looke up toward God, doth in that phraſe call us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, to truſt in him, to love him &amp; to aſpire unto him: <hi>Pſal. 123.2. Eſa. 17.7. &amp; 45.22.</hi> ſo when he made Adam in ſuch a forme with his head and eyes lift up, even in that manner of work the Lord called him to looke to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and to embrace him the author of all his good. Beſides this what are all the ſenſes of the body but ſo many inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our communion with God, or ſo many doores of the ſoule by which both the Lord enters in to ſhew himſelfe, and the ſoule goes out to behold him? By them his praiſe is heard, his glory is ſeene, his goodnes &amp; gifts are taſted, his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſmelled, yea &amp; groaped or handled of us. <hi>Actes. 17.27.</hi> By them both faith &amp; love &amp; feare of God is learned.

                  <p>The fearfulnes &amp; greevouſnes of the ſecond death ſet forth by (a) The deſerving cauſe, Sinne, which is eſpecially aggravated by the wiſedome, authority, goodnes, &amp; other attributes of God: (b) The inflicting cauſe, the wrath of God, from which the whole miſery &amp; all the circumſtances of the ſecond death have their denominations; (c) compared unto fire, yet different from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fire, unquenchable, moſt piercing, largely extending it ſelfe, &amp; taking hold on the greateſt in the world: (d) This fire &amp; the fiercenes of it made plaine by the obſervation of ſundry fires al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready kindled in the bowels of the earth, in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative &amp; ſenſitive creatures, in the body of man, in the aire &amp; firmament, in the angels, (e) but chiefly in the courſe of Gods juſt indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners, ſeriouſly to be conſidered of all that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14270:54"/>
deſire to eſcape it. (f) The effects, dolefull cryes &amp; lamentations of the tormented, of the Devils themſelves, yea even of our bleſſed Saviour in his ſufferings. (g) Particular manifeſtations of Gods wrath againſt particular ſinnes &amp; tranſgreſſions of every commandement, both of the firſt &amp; ſecond table.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe end of all fleſh hath bene repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us of God by a baſket of ſummer fruit, ripe for the harveſt, ready to be gathered. The bleſſed end of the godly hath bene ſhewed in the baſket of good figs, very good: there remaines yet the baſket of rotten figs, very naught, to be marked of us; for that ſight is alſo propounded unto us of God &amp; he calles us to remember the end of the wicked thereby, whiles that baſket was in viſion alſo ſet before the Temple of the Lord. <hi>Ier. 24.1.</hi> It is an hideous &amp; fearefull ſight to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the graves where the greene carcaſes of dead men doe lye, to behold the grieſlines &amp; lothſomnes of death in them, and who doth not flie from it? But much more horrour it is to looke upon the dead ſoules in Hell, their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; lothſome eſtate being an hundred times more &amp; worſe to be endured then the ſight of any rotten carcaſſes in the grave: Yet are we called of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

ſame offences of ſtriking or curſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt others were not ſo, though ſome childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might happily have as much wiſedome as their father &amp; mother, yet their authority alone being deſpiſed, brought ſuch woe. Now the authority of God the heavenly father over his creature being infinitely greater then the authority of any earthly father over his children; the contempt thereof doth accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an infinite woe unto thoſe that diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, that reject his Law &amp; make their owne luſt their law, &amp; prefer the doing of their owne vile wills before the obedience of his holy &amp; heavenly will.</p>
               <p>So in like manner the infinite evill of ſinne appeareth diſtinctly in this, that it is committed againſt the infinite goodnes &amp; mercy of God. There are in creatures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold degrees of love &amp; kindnes: &amp; the love of one doth an hundred times exceed the love of ſome other, both in tendernes of affection &amp; in multitude of benefits. And in ſuch caſe the treachery of ſuch as deale falſely &amp; wickedly againſt their cheefeſt friends, becomes an hundredfold greater evill then the ſin of ſome others. Now the Lord is love it ſelfe; <hi>1. Ioh. 4.8.16.</hi> &amp; herein is love, not that we love God,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14270:55"/>
but that he loved us: <hi>verſ. 10.</hi> his grace &amp; the gifts of his eternall &amp; free grace doe infinitely exceed all other love; he gave himſelfe to be our God &amp; portion, his Sonne to be our ranſome. And therefore to ſin againſt this high &amp; immeaſurable grace; to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne this love &amp; to love that which is vanitie of vanities more then God, doth make the ſin of ſuch to be out of meaſure ſinfull, &amp; deſerveth an infinite hatred &amp; miſery to enſue thereupon.</p>
               <p>And thus the greevouſnes of ſinne is to be conſidered &amp; conceived in reſpect of the other divine attributes; whereby we may ſee as it were, ten infinites in one &amp; behold many windowes of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion opened before us, through which we may have a huge &amp; vaſt proſpect of the endles &amp; unſearchable woe of ſinne, that is to be felt in the ſecond death. Though there be many other aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne, yet this ſo farre exceeds the reſt as if they all were nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of this: therefore doth the Spirit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten urge this conſideration upon men, ſaying to the ſinners, <hi>Ye have lyed, not unto men but unto God: Act. 5.4.</hi> &amp; <hi>he that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not man, but God, vvho hath alſo given us his holy Spirit, 1.

and it containes more then a world of bookes can expreſſe.</p>
               <p>(c) This fierce wrath of God is often in Scripture compared unto burning &amp; devouring fire; <hi>Deut. 32.22. Ier. 15.14. &amp; 17.4. Ezek. 21.31. &amp; 22.21. &amp; 36.5. Zeph. 1.18.</hi> &amp; accordingly is the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in hell deſcribed unto us by the name of hellfire. <hi>Matt. 5.22. &amp; 18.9.</hi> The ſmarting paine cauſed by fire is well knowne by the common uſe thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: And yet above the nature of common fire, which is made for the comfort of man, to cheere him &amp; to make him laugh, <hi>Eſa. 44.16.</hi> this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fire of hell is propounded unto us of God by many ſtrange deſcriptions. It is a fire not like unto ours that may be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but an unquenchable fire; <hi>Eſa. 66.24. Mark. 9.44 Rev. 14.11.</hi> an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, <hi>Matt. 18.8. &amp; 25.41.</hi> which ſo burnes the wicked as that it doth not conſume them, but keeps them alive in death, that they may burne for ever and ever. It is a fire that will not onely burne ſtones, melt yron &amp; braſſe, but a ſubtile, piercing fire, that burnes even the ſpirits &amp; ſoules of men; being a fire prepared for the devill &amp; his angels, which are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14270:56"/>
ſpirits, <hi>Matt. 25.41. Rev. 20.10.</hi> and therefore farre more terrible then our fire by which tyrants burne the bodies of martyrs, but cannot burne their ſoules. <hi>Mat. 10.28.</hi> For the greatnes of it, it is a bottomleſſe pit; <hi>Rev. 9.1.2.</hi> deep &amp; large; <hi>Eſa. 30.33.</hi> a lake or ſea of fire, <hi>Rev. 20.14.15.</hi> for the names of lake or ſea are ſometimes in Scripture indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put one for another: <hi>Matt. 8.24. with Luk. 8.23.</hi> and this burning ſea is withall called a lake of brimſtone, <hi>Rev. 19.20. &amp; 20.10.</hi> which makes the fire to burne more cruelly, to choake &amp; ſtrangle ſuch as are plunged into this lake. And for the forme of it, it is ſometimes compared to an oven, or furnace of fire, <hi>Mal. 4.1. Mat. 13.42.50.</hi> in which the fire being kept cloſe &amp; ſtrait, may be made ſeven times more hote &amp; fierce then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Dan. 3.19.</hi> To make this fire yet more abhominable, it is compared unto Tophet, <hi>Eſa. 30.33.</hi> where children were burnt in horrible &amp; lothſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, being ſacrificed unto devils: <hi>Ier. 7.31. with Pſa. 106.37.</hi> &amp; ſo &amp; more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible would it be to ſee the ſoules ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in Hell-fire. Were there now but a witch to be burned at a ſtake, how many
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14270:57"/>
thouſands would flock together to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſight? how many would looſe a dayes work &amp; be content to miſſe their dinners, rather then to miſſe the ſight of it? But if it were to ſee a King or an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour burnt; to ſee a Pope or a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, which having burnt many martyrs ſhould at length have their owne fleſh burnt with fire; how many farre and neere would run and ride and ſpare no coſt or labour to become ſpectatours of ſuch a judgment? how long, how often, how earneſtly would men talke of it afterwards? And yet this fire of the ſecond death is for ſuch: by faith we ſee it; faith makes us ſpectatours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if we beleeve the Scriptures, which ſhew us how Tophet is prepared for kings; <hi>Eſa. 30.33.</hi> how the beaſt and the falſe prophet, the Popes, are to be caſt alive into the lake of fire and brimſtone; <hi>Rev. 19.20. &amp; 20.10.</hi> and with them the multitude of their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and other abhominable perſons <hi>Rev. 21.8.</hi> And how are men bewitched that they forget this latter end of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that they more regard the light and momentany judgments of men, then the eternall and ſevere judgments of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14270:57"/>
everlaſting God? This lake of fire is ſo forgotten and contemned of many which ſtand dayly at the brink of the pit, ready to ſinke downe into it for their ſinnes, as if that fire were already quenched: yea the very common knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof by all ſorts, hath quenched the thought of it and extinguiſhed the memory and mencion of it with many, as if it were ſo well knowne, that it needed no more to be ſpoken of. And for this cauſe are many tumbled into it &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the depth of it before they be aware of it.</p>
               <p>(d) The power of Gods wrath in kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling this fire may further be perceived, if we behold the great variety of ſtrange fires which God in his works of creation &amp; providence hath already kindled and ſet before us, to ſhew what he is able to doe. In the bowels of the earth below, the Lord hath as it were, ſowne the ſeeds of fire in the divers minerals thereof, as in the mines of coales, in the veines of vitrioll, of ſalt-peter, of lime, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other things whereby from under the earth is turned up as it were fire: <hi>Iob. 28.5.</hi> and to ſhew a moſt wofull bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it is ſayd, The people ſhall be as the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14270:58"/>
burnings of lime. <hi>Eſa. 33.12.</hi> Above u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the face of the earth the Lord hath planted divers growing fires in ſundry hote herbes; ſome burning &amp; bliſtering the ſkinne outwardly by the very touch thereof, as the nettle with ſome other kinde of thiſtles &amp; venomous thornes, whoſe innumerable prickes ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power of God to curſe the wicked; ſome other herbs being taken inwardly, as Hellebore, Coloquintida (or the wild gourd that brought death into the pot, <hi>2. Kin. 4.39.40.)</hi> Euphorbium &amp; the like doe caſt the body into miſerable paine &amp; diſtreſſe, burning, exulcerating, gnawing, grating &amp; tearing the intrals, toſſing and tormenting the body with vomits, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with ſwooning &amp; fainting, with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent convulſions &amp; fearfull ſymptomes. In the ſenſitive creatures God hath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many kindes of living &amp; going fire, walking to &amp; fro in the earth, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers poyſons of ſundry ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſome cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping under our feet, ſome flying over our heads, as in the hornet, the ſnake, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, aſpe, cockatrice, &amp; thoſe fiery flying ſerpents that ſting &amp; burne men to the death. <hi>Num. 21.6. Eſa. 14.29.</hi> To come neerer ourſelves, in the body of man God
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14270:58"/>
kindleth many ſtrange fires in the ſundry diſeaſes thereof, both by painefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of particular parts, both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward &amp; inward, &amp; eſpecially by that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall fire of the burning fevers flaming out of the heart into the whole body: <hi>Deut. 28.22.</hi> &amp; this in great variety, ſome inflaming the ſpirits onely; ſome the blood alſo; &amp; ſome conſuming the very ſubſtance of the ſolid parts alſo: ſome bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a ſimple exceſſe of heat; others conſiſting in rotten &amp; corrupt humours doe burne the body more cruelly: &amp; of theſe againe ſome burning continually, night &amp; day without intermiſſion, as the fire in glaſſe houſes &amp; the furnaces where yron is melted; others by fitts comming at appoynted ſeaſons &amp; after certain peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of time, either every day, or each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third day, like fire raked under aſhes &amp; kindled againe upon occaſion: ſome others againe conſiſting of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant &amp; poyſonous fire, as in the peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall fevers that burne more cruelly &amp; deadly then the reſt, theſe are like going or running fires through their contagion ſpreading abroad, walking in darkneſſe, deſtroying at noone, &amp; flying as poyſoned arrowes by their infection, &amp; breaking
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14270:59"/>
out in boyles &amp; carbuncles like ſo many fiery furnaces or ovens comming up in the fleſh. <hi>Pſa. 91.3.6. Eſa. 38 21.</hi> And by theſe with their compounds the Lord kindleth a burning lake within the body, maketh the veines which containe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed blood &amp; humours to be like ſo many rivers of pitch &amp; brimſtone, and ſo cauſeth an unquenchable thirſt &amp; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable paine that followes it. In the aire &amp; clouds above our heads God kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth terrible fires by thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der &amp; lightnings, divideth the flames &amp; ſhooteth abroad his fiery darts to conſume his enimies. <hi>Pſa. 18.12.13.14.</hi> Above the clouds in the firmament, God kindleth another fire by the Sunne &amp; ſome other ſtarres, and ſmites the earth &amp; her inhabitants with the beames thereof, ſo that they are ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with heate &amp; faint in themſelves. <hi>Pſal. 121.6. with Rev. 7.16. &amp; 16.8.9. Ion. 4.8.</hi> To goe higher into the third heavens God hath there alſo kindled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fires; he maketh his Angels to be flames of fire; <hi>Heb 1.7.</hi> to be horſes &amp; charets of fire; <hi>2. Kin. 6.17. &amp; 2.11.</hi> to be burning Seraphims, <hi>Eſa. 6.2.</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſame name that is before given to the fiery ſerpents. <hi>Numb. 21.6.</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14270:59"/>
his Cherubims like coales of fire, as the appearance of lampes &amp; as the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of lightning; &amp; from them are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered coales of fire over countries &amp; cities for their puniſhment. <hi>Ezek. 1.13.14. with cha. 10.2.7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(e) But above all theſe, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is a conſuming fire; <hi>Deut. 4.24. &amp; 9.3. Heb. 12.29.</hi> &amp; an everlaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <hi>Eſa. 33.14.</hi> when he riſeth up to judge the world &amp; to plead with ſecure ſinners, how can they ſtand before his angry face? His throne is a fiery flame, his wheeles as burning fire; &amp; a fiery ſtreame iſſueth &amp; commeth forth from before him, &amp; conſumeth round about: <hi>Dan. 7.9.10. Pſa. 97.3.</hi> his face is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <hi>Eſa. 30.27.</hi> his eyes flaming; <hi>Rev. 1.14.</hi> his noſtrils ſmoaking; <hi>Pſa. 18.8.</hi> his tongue a devouring fire; his breath an overflowing ſtreame, &amp; as a river of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to kindle Tophet: <hi>Eſa. 30.27.28.33.</hi> from his loynes upward &amp; from his loynes downeward all as the appearance of fire: <hi>Ezek. 1.27.</hi> &amp; when he ſhall be revealed from heaven, he is to come in flaming fire with his mighty angels round about him, all of them like ſo many ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beames of his glory, pointed with
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14270:60"/>
indignation &amp; ſparkling with wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſinners that are frozen in their dreggs. <hi>2. Theſ. 1.7.8. Iude. 14.</hi> And yet further to ſhew the greatnes of this wrath, we are to remember that each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the H. Trinity burneth with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct flame of wrath againſt the wicked: The Lord from the Lord raines fire and brimſtone; <hi>Gen. 19.24.</hi> The Son comes in the glory of his Father; <hi>Matt. 16.27.</hi> The holy Spirit is a ſpirit of judgment &amp; a ſpirit of burning: <hi>Eſa. 4 4.</hi> as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit mooved upon the waters in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, <hi>Gen. 1.2.</hi> ſo ſhall it moove upon the fire of Gods judgments in the end of the world for the conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of ſinners. All other fires in the creature are but ſparkles &amp; leſſe then nothing in reſpect of this infinite wrath of God.</p>
               <p>This is the latter end of wicked men, never to be forgotten. When the Lord warned the Iewes of their deſtruction &amp; of their end that was comming, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to conſider how earneſtly he cryes unto them, &amp; how many repetitions he uſeth, worthy to be numbred &amp; counted exactly of every one, whiles he calles upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, <hi>An end, an end is come; the end is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14270:60"/>
come: An evill, an onely evill, behold it is come: An end is come, the end is come, it vvatcheth for thee, behold it is come. The morning is come unto thee; the time is come, the day of trouble is neere, &amp; not the eccho of the mountaines &amp;c. Behold the day, behold it is come, the morning is gone forth, the rod hath bloſsomed, pride hath budded &amp;c. The time is come, the day dravveth neere &amp;c. Ezek. 7.2.3.5.6.7.10.12.</hi> Thus doth the Lord ſpread out his hands unto ſinners, to warne them of their end: &amp; they are worthy to feele the ſmart of that eternall fire, that neither by the terrour of his wrath propounded, nor by the carefull love of God in admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thereof, will be drawne to looke in this burning glaſſe &amp; to thinke upon this laſt end. Were we wiſe, we ſhould run oftner to warme our ſoules with this fire by the meditation of it, then we bring our bodies to any other fire; to heate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with zeale of the Lord, &amp; to drive away that lukewarmnes of our ſoules that is ſo abhominable in the ſight of God. <hi>Rev. 3.16.</hi> The Apoſtle teacheth us to make this uſe of the aforeſaid conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, for the change of our converſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto all holines &amp; godly life. 2. <hi>Pet. 3.11.</hi> And from hence may we learne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14270:61"/>
in ſuffering as well as obedience in doing the will of God, as the Spirit tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us: if the Lord be at hand; if the end of all things be at hand, &amp; ſuch an end, why ſhould not our patient minde, our moderation and ſobriety be made knowne unto all upon all occaſions? <hi>Phil. 4.5. 1. Pet. 4.7.</hi> Though injuries be done vnto us, great &amp; dayly &amp; in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, both unchriſtian &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane dealing, yet ſeing the comming of the Lord draweth nigh, the Iudge is at the doore, at the threſhold and entrance of our houſe, and there is but a ſtep betwixt us &amp; him, but an inch of time betwixt our ſufferings and his judgement, therefore he requireth of us that we be patient &amp; eſtabliſh our hearts in him. <hi>Iam. 5.8.9.</hi> Have we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſſes &amp; troubles in the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we winne or looſe it ſkilles not much; whether we purchaſe &amp; buy with increaſe of gaine or whether we ſell for neceſſity, whether we be rich or poore it is no great matter, ſeing the earth &amp; all the works thereof are in a moment to be burnt up; <hi>2. Pet. 3.10.</hi> &amp; ſeing the end haſteneth &amp; the world paſſeth away, let not the buyer rejoyce nor the ſeller
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14270:61"/>
mourne. <hi>Ezek. 7.12.</hi> All the happines of man ſtands in being delivered from this everlaſting fire, kindled by the fierce wrath of God againſt ſinne. We have enough &amp; may well be content while we have our ſoule ſaved as a prey from this great deſtruction.</p>
               <p>(f) If yet we be dull of hearing &amp; cannot ſee the dreadfulnes of this death in the cauſes thereof, the ſinne of man deſerving it &amp; the wrath of God inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it; if yet we deſire a plainer evidence thereof let us then looke upon the effects thereof &amp; conſider how the ſmart of this ſecond death ſhall make the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hell to crye &amp; waile &amp; take up eternall lamentations without any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or end. By the effects of ſorrow Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy thus deſcribeth the affliction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her captivity, that of a princeſſe being become a deſolate widow, ſhe did weep ſore in the night, that her teares were on her cheekes; that they ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe as a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver night &amp; day, the apple of her eye never ceaſſing; that her elders &amp; her infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, young men &amp; virgines, did mourne together; that the prieſts &amp; prophets did ſigh, their eyes being dimmed &amp; fayling with teares, their bowels troubled, their liver powred

thus roare &amp; faint in themſelves under this burden of ſorrow, how can any men or Giants that are but fleſh undergoe the ſame? When the Lord ſhall pleade againſt the proud &amp; covetous, &amp; cauſe his wrath to ſmoake againſt hypocrites &amp; diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, againſt profane men, drunkards, adulterers &amp; malicious men; how can their heart endure, or their hands be ſtrong? <hi>Ezek. 22.14.</hi> Though they were as ſtout as the devils, they ſhall be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed &amp; broken together with them. Now many ſkorners make a mock of religion: now the epicures make a ſport of ſinne: now the obſtinate perſons deſpiſe admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition &amp; hate to be reformed; they ſet their faces as Adamants in their obſtinacy: But though their bones were braſſe, &amp; their ſtrength of ſtones, &amp; their heart as hard as the nether milſtone; yet ſhall they be ground to peeces with this wrath of God that grindes the very Devils to powder &amp; makes them to howle &amp; yell before him.</p>
               <p>Above all other, the moſt terrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Gods wrath, was that which was ſhewed upon Chriſt Ieſus, the Lord of men &amp; angels, when as he being become our ſurety &amp; bearing our ſins; did groane

The Fire by which Hell is ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, is of a conſuming &amp; devouring nature: this operation of it is often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to eating, &amp; the fewell put unto it is the meat thereof; <hi>Eſa. 9.19.</hi> the more it hath, the more hungrily it eateth, by burning more fiercely: it hath an inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble belly &amp; never ſaith, It is enough. <hi>Prov. 30.15.16.</hi> And ſo it is like unto Hell, which enlargeth herſelfe &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her mouth wide &amp; without meaſure to devoure the wicked. <hi>Eſa. 5.14.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conceive it as the higheſt &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt element, encompaſſing the aire on every ſide, as in the proper place that is commonly aſſigned unto it, or whether we looke upon it in the dayly effects thereof on the earth, in thoſe few ſparkles &amp; coales thereof ſcattered among us here below for our uſe, it carries in it both wayes a reſemblance of Hell, to make us remember the end of the wicked in the ſight of it.</p>

Therefore is the Devill called the prince of the power of the aire, <hi>Eph. 2.2.</hi> &amp; his angels are ſpirituall wickedneſſes in high places; <hi>Eph. 6.12.</hi> &amp; Satan is ſayd to fall downe like lightning from heaven when his works are looſed. <hi>Luk. 10.18.</hi> So often as we looke out into the aire, ſo oft doe we paſſe by the gates of Hell, by the Caſtles &amp; Towers of the enimy from whence he ſhootes his fiery darts, from whence he watcheth his advantage to oppugne us &amp; to make a prey of our ſoules. <hi>1.

And if Ionas being ſwallowed up of one of them did account himſelfe in the belly of hell, <hi>Ion. 2.2.</hi> then muſt there be many hells in one ſea. Yea the very torments of Hell which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour endured for us are repreſented by the deep whereinto he was plunged, &amp; by the waters that entred into his ſoule: <hi>Pſa. 69.1.2.15.</hi> &amp; further the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> or bottomleſſe pit, whereby Hell is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Rev. 9.1. &amp; 20.1.</hi> is the ſame word whereby the deep ſea is commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.

As in Corahs time the earth opened her mouth &amp; ſwallowed many at once; <hi>Num. 16.31.32.33.</hi> ſo doth it ſtill every day; the difference is onely in the manner, that there it opened of it ſelfe, here it is opened by the grave-maker. Yea &amp; further the deep pits of mire &amp; clay in the earth are likewiſe choſen by the holy Ghoſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the deſcending of our Redeemer into Hell, &amp; the ſorrowes of the ſecond death that he endured therein: <hi>Pſa. 40.2. &amp; 69.2.</hi> inſomuch that many doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the proper place of Hell is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the earth; which though we neither affirme nor deny, but reprove their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which without warrant will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily maintaine the ſame; yet in the pits of this earth we have an hell reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled unto us even by the Spirit of God in the Scriptures.

Among other particular nations &amp; countries &amp; above them all as the head &amp; crowne of the earth, let us in the firſt place looke upon Eden &amp; the paradiſe therein, from whence man was baniſhed for his ſinne. The Lord as he had at firſt even in the ſtate of innocency, planted a tree of forbidden fruit within the garden, as a memoriall of death, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſecond death, &amp; conſequently of an Hell provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for tranſgreſſours; <hi>Gen. 2.9.17.</hi> ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall, without the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof he placed there on the Eaſt ſide a flaming ſword which turned every way to keepe the way of the tree of life. <hi>Gen. 3.24.</hi> This flame of deſtruction was like another viſible Hell in the eyes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; his poſterity, by the dayly ſight whereof they were warned not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume againſt the commandement of God as they had done.

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of Mortification or the death of ſinne.</hi>
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The nature &amp; neceſſity thereof in generall. (a) Six ſpeciall degrees of mortification: 1. In ſeverall paſſions of the minde troubled at the apprehenſion of ſinne; 2. In reſiſting &amp; refraining of ſinfull actions, 3. of wicked purpoſes, 4. tickling deſires, 5. wandring imaginations, 6. habituall concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. (b) The ſayd acts of mortification like ſo many battels in our ſpirituall warfare, &amp; as many parts of that contrition which is acceptable unto God &amp; hath the promiſes. (c) The example of David mortifying ſinne in each of the particulars afore named. (d) The chiefe evils of ſinne that are to be mortifyed, The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes &amp; the pride of life. (e) By theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan workes his temptations, &amp; by the mortifying of theſe he is conquered, as it is ſhewed in the examples of Adam, (f) Chriſt, (g) Antichriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving heard of the love of God, which is the ſpring of life, &amp; of the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the way unto that life; it remaines that we ſeeke the communion of the H. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the concluſion of our comfort for the aſſurance of that life. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. Hereby we know that we have fellowſhip with God, that he abideth in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.24.

ſhall be comforted. <hi>Matt. 5.4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. After this followes an other degree of Mortification, whereby the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full according to the meaſure of grace given, doe turne from the practiſe of ſinne which they have bewayled. They doe not live any longer therein, <hi>Rom. 6.2.</hi> they ceaſe to doe evill, <hi>Eſa. 1.16.</hi> and eſchew evill: <hi>Iob 1.1.8.</hi> they forſake their owne wayes and courſes, and breake of their ſinnes, <hi>Eſa. 55.7.</hi> and refraine their feet from every evill way. <hi>Pſalm. 119.101.</hi> By this reſiſting of wicked actions men are ſayd to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify or kill the deeds of the body and thereupon is life promiſed unto them. <hi>Rom. 8.13.</hi> They therefore that love life everlaſting muſt every day die this death alſo in caſting off the workes of darkenes. Though it be a death to the fleſh to leave them, yet muſt this death alſo be undergone; els is there no hope of life, no aſſurance that God dwelleth in us by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>III. An other death of the old man is when not onely the outward act of ſinne, but the will and purpoſe of ſinning is mortifyed. The will of the fleſh and the will of man is noted as a
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14270:97"/>
thing oppoſite to God and his Spirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his wrath &amp; making men the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath; <hi>Ioh. 1.13. Eph.</hi> 2.3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.<hi>2.3.</hi> and many that want the power to performe many evils, doe not yet want the will thereunto; and therefore this will is to be mortifyed. If he that had no ſtaine in his will, could yet ſay unto his Father, <hi>Not as I vvill but as thou vvilt; Not my will but thy will be done: Matt. 26.39. Luk. 22.42.</hi> and againe, I <hi>ſeek not mine owne will, but the will of him that ſent me; Iohn. 5.30. &amp; 6.38.</hi> how much more ſhould we make it our dayly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to break our owne corrupt willes, to caſt away our owne purpoſes and to wait on God all the day long, ſaying and praying continually, Not my will but thy will be done? At the firſt act of Pauls converſion, ſo ſoone as Chriſt was made knowne unto him, we ſee this mortification of his will which he renounced, &amp; reſigning himſelfe to the will of God ſayd, <hi>Lord vvhat vvilt thou that I doe? Act. 9.6.</hi> When the will is thus mortifyed, though men doe ſometimes the things that they would not; yet then is this comfort afforded; it is no more they that doe it but ſinne that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14270:98"/>
dwelleth in them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15.16.17.19-20. It ſhall not be imputed unto them.</p>
               <p>IV. Beſides this it comes to paſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that when the will is ſubdued &amp; reſtrained from ſome evill, yet the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not mortifyed: though a ſinner in the purpoſe of his will, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the practiſe of ſome evill, yet the heart is tickled with delight therein, and could wiſh it were lawfull, and it is a paine unto them that they may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſeek it. This evill concupiſcence &amp; luſt of the heart, theſe affections of the fleſh are diſtinctly condemned, &amp; we are commanded to mortify &amp; to avoyd ſuch inordinate paſſions; even as they are luſts, though conſent of the will be not with them. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Exo.</hi> 20.17. In the killing &amp; abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe luſts the faithfull endure many deathes from day to day, &amp; the acts of Mortification are multiplyed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtrength of the ſpirit miniſtred unto them.</p>
               <p>V. Againe the minde of man is dayly annoyed &amp; peſtred with evill thoughts &amp; wandring imaginations ariſing partly from the fleſh &amp; partly from the ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satan; and theſe though they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14270:98"/>
be delighted in nor approoved of, yet the very entertainment of them and their reſidence in the minde though for a ſhort while, doth pollute the ſoule with ſinne. For God requireth the whole ſoule and the whole minde with all the ſtrength thereof; <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.27 he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a pure heart, free from all ſtragling conceits. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.8. Our eyes ſhould ever be towards the Lord &amp; his glory: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.15. Lots wife for looking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was ſmitten of God and turned into a pillar of ſalt; <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.17.26. &amp; though more evill might be in her minde, yet that very look alone being forbidden of God made her culpable: and ſo for a ſide look unto vanity, when the eye of the minde rolles up and downe we become guilty of condemnation. Theſe idle thoughts take up the place in the ſoule, even the ſeat wherein God ſhould ſit; and while they keepe out the thought of God, though but for a moment, they are in that reſpect condemnable. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe motions of the minde are to be reſiſted, repelled &amp; mortifyed. As Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham huſhed away the foules that came downe upon his ſacrifice; <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.11. ſo are theſe flying thoughts to be diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14270:99"/>
and driven away from our mindes. God requireth that the wicked ſhould forſake his imaginations; <hi>Eſa. 55.7.</hi> God would have his children to caſt downe imaginations and to bring every thought captive unto the obedience of Chriſt, <hi>2. Cor. 10.5.</hi> which cannot fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly be done without this mortification of them. By mortification of them the heart is purged, &amp; then the promiſe of mercy multiplyed. <hi>Iam. 4.8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Laſtly the faithfull doe yet in a further degree die unto ſinne, when as that habituall concupiſcence which is the ſeedplot and root of all other ſinnes is mortifyed and ſubdued within them. For beſides all the motions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and other fruits of ſinne before noted, there is in man a corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, whereby he is enclined to all evill. This diſpoſition &amp; pronenes to ſinne, conſidered apart from the fruits thereof, is condemned in the Scripture, &amp; is called the old man, the body of ſin, the law of ſin &amp; the law of the members; <hi>Rom. 6.6. Eph. 4.22. Col. 3.2. Rom. 7.23.</hi> it is called the fleſh which luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit, and therefore is to be crucifyed as well as the luſts and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:14270:99"/>
affections thereof. <hi>Gal. 5.17.24.</hi> This is that hatefull and poyſonous Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice egge, to be cruſhed before ſerpents creep out of it. The godly therefore knowing this their owne corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt labour to have it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and weakened dayly within them: and to this end they are to watch their heart with all diligence, <hi>Prover. 4.23.</hi> and even before they feele any ſtirring or motion of the fleſh, to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of themſelves in all godlines and in all holy meditations and prayer, to keepe under their rebellious nature, and by the help of the Spirit to bring it into ſubjection, <hi>1. Corint. 9.27.</hi> to binde the very ſtumpe of this tree with an yron band of mortification, that the forbidden fruits doe not bud forth.</p>
               <p>(b) The life of a Chriſtian in this world is a continuall warfare, in which they fight the battailes of the Lord every day and houre. <hi>2. Cor. 10.4. 1. Tim. 6.12.</hi> Theſe ſpirituall combates according to the actes and degrees before named, are ſix in ſpeciall. Firſt they conquer the Adamantine Rock, <hi>Zach. 7.12.</hi> when their hard hearts are ſoftened to

againe by the baniſhment of wandring thoughts &amp; motions; &amp; moſt of all bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſinfull diſpoſition of the fleſh is broken &amp; mortifyed. All theſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; breakings are ſo many pleaſant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of ſweet odour unto God: &amp; to them that undergoe ſo many deathes he hath made many precious promiſes; that he will revive the ſpirit of the humble, &amp; give life unto the contrite ones; that he who is high &amp; excellent, inhabiting eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on high will dwell here below with him that is lowly; that he whoſe name is the Holy One, will dwell with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſinner: <hi>Eſa. 57.</hi>15. &amp; 66.1.2. and therefore if the preſence &amp; converſation of God with us be of any regard with us, if the glory &amp; life that God gives be of any account in our eyes, let us give our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dayly to theſe workes of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by theſe foregoing deathes we may be made ready to leave this world, &amp; may in the end finde him &amp; with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort come before him that is the well of life.</p>
               <p>(c) For the illuſtration of this poynt, to omit others, conſider we the example of David alone, how he was exerciſed in all theſe acts of contrition &amp; thereby dyed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14270:100"/>
unto ſinne. The divers degrees of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification were ſo many ſteppes of the ſtaires by which he deſcended into the death of ſinne, dying as it were a ſeverall death upon each one of them. 1. After knowledge &amp; conviction of ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as for the numbring of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his heart ſmote him for it, <hi>2. Sam. 24.10.</hi> and that was a blow or ſtroak of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification which the ſpirit gave unto the fleſh; he mourned exceedingly, and in a revengefull indignation againſt his owne ſinne was content &amp; deſired that the hand of God might be againſt him &amp; againſt his fathers houſe, that he might beare the ſmart of his owne tranſgreſſion. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. this was a death of ſinne in him. And ſo it was alſo with the ſinne he conmitted in the matter of Vrias, for which his bones were broken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. and for which he made himſelfe a publick example, by the confeſſion of his ſinne &amp; making a dolefull ſong thereof to the ſhaming of himſelfe &amp; warning of others. <hi>The title of Pſal.</hi> 51.11. David went a ſtep lower, when he mortifyed &amp; reſiſted the act of ſinne, though occaſion &amp; opportunity of revenge was given unto him, though counſell was given him by others to that

                  <hi>If I ſay, I vvill judge thus: Behold I ſhould offend againſt the generation of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. verſ.</hi> 15. VI. Laſtly David came downe to the loweſt ſtep of the ſtaires, when in the mortification of his ſinne he ſtroke upon the root thereof, by bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his originall corruption &amp; ſeeking to ſubdue that ſinfull diſpoſition received from his parents, while he complaineth, <hi>Behold I vvas borne in iniquity &amp; in ſinne hath my mother conceived me. Pſalm. 51.5.</hi> This old nature he labours to mortify, when he deſires to be renewed in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his minde; <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. for as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle reaſoned in reſpect of the covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. in that he mentioneth a new eſtate he deſires the aboliſhing &amp; decay of the old. Thus true mortification never ceaſeth till it bring men from &amp; by the hatred of actual ſinnes to finde out the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, the cauſe &amp; mother of all, by which all men together are become unprofitable &amp; filthy; <hi>Pſal. 53.3. vvith Rom. 3.12.</hi> that they may kill &amp; crucifye the ſame. This mortification of the old man is alſo comprehended in that ſpeech of David when he ſaith, <hi>I kept me from mine iniquity: Pſal.</hi> 18.23. for though it be true that he kept himſelfe from his wickednes &amp; from
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14270:101"/>
his ſinne that dwelt in him by bewailing ſins already committed, by reſiſting the preſent actions, by breaking his will, by renouncing his affections, by caſting downe his imaginations; yet in ſpeciall manner he kept himſelfe from his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, by mortifying his very diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to evill, while he laboured to change his nature &amp; to have a new diſpoſition created within him. Theſe are the deathes that David dyed; &amp; theſe are the deathes to be undergone of all that would not dye eternally. This dayly dying unto ſinne by ſo many leſſer deathes, is a maine prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative unto the great day of our tranſlation out of this world which ought evermore to be remembred of us.</p>
               <p>(d) After the actes of mortification &amp; the divers degrees thereof, it is expedient that we conſider the ſpeciall enimies or evills of ſinne that are to be mortifyed. Theſe the holy Ghoſt informes us to be <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, &amp; the pride of life;</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16. that is to ſay, voluptuouſnes, covetouſnes, &amp; ambition or vaine-glory. To theſe three may be reduced the principall workes of the fleſh or old man, conſidering that for theſe and from theſe doe ariſe the contentions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:14270:102"/>
envy, lying, ſlandering &amp; manifold other iniquities, <hi>Iam. 4.1.2.</hi> which are therefore noted &amp; deſcribed as compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons waiting upon the forenamed luſts, which are the three ſeditious captaines &amp; leaders unto all miſchiefe. <hi>Gal. 5.19.20.21. Col. 3.5.8.9. Eph. 5.22.31.</hi> Theſe luſts are the root of all evill, not onely of all wrong, injuſtice &amp; cruell dealing towards men, but of all irreligion &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety againſt God. The cares of this world the deceitfulnes of riches, &amp; the luſts of other things as the pleaſures of this life, choke the word of God &amp; make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull: <hi>Mark. 4.19. Luk. 8.14.</hi> the fruits of holines &amp; righteouſnes are blaſted and deſtroyed thereby. And ſome through theſe luſts have erred from the faith, being inſnared with fooliſh and abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, noyſome alſo and hurtfull in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all graces weakned by them, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the heart with preſent ſorrowes, and finally caſting men into eternall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perdition. 1. <hi>Tim. 6.9.10.</hi> Theſe are of the world &amp; not of God, and if any man be a lover of the world and of theſe things of the world, then is not the love of the Father in him; 1. <hi>Ioh. 2.15.16.</hi> then is he made the enimy of God, for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14270:102"/>
of theſe luſts and his amity with them; <hi>Iam. 4.4.</hi> and conſequently cannot looke for the fruits of that bleſſed friendſhip with God: but for ſuch remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a fearefull exſpectation of judgment &amp; death in the day of Gods wrath. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men die for ever becauſe they live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh &amp; doe not die betimes to theſe ſinfull luſts. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.</p>
               <p>(e) As the world, ſo the Devill alſo, by the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes and the pride of life both worketh his chief temptations &amp; by the mortifying of thoſe he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered, &amp; by mens yeelding unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he overcommeth &amp; devoureth them. This appeareth in three moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable examples, of Adam, Chriſt, and Antichriſt. At the temptation of our firſt parents the Devill uſed theſe three baites &amp; thereby enſnared them. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden tree by his ſuggeſtion appeared good for meat, <hi>Gen. 3.6.</hi> to bring them to covetouſnes not content with all the other trees of paradiſe, as though there had not bene meat enough for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this alſo; it appeared pleaſant to the eyes, to kindle the luſt of falſe and vaine pleaſure in them; and by his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion it appeared as a tree deſirable

by which the Devill workes ſo effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him and in others by him, are thoſe three forenamed luſts: for by theſe three is Antichriſt often deſcribed. In reſpect of the luſt of the fleſh, the habitation and denne of Antichriſt is a ſpiriruall Sodom, <hi>Rev. 11.8.</hi> abounding with luſts of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous uncleannes; the Romiſh city is compared to a great Harlot &amp; the mother of harlots, having in her hand a great cup full of abominations &amp; filthineſſe of her fornication, <hi>Rev. 17.1.4.5.</hi> and living deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly in pleaſures. <hi>Rev. 18.7.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the luſt of the eyes &amp; love of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſhe is decked with gold &amp; precious ſtone &amp; pearles: <hi>Rev. 17.4. &amp; 18.16.</hi> and for increaſe &amp; maintenance of that wealth her ſervants &amp; miniſters through cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes and with fained words doe make merchandiſe of men. <hi>2. Pet. 2.3.</hi> And as for the pride of life this man of ſinne doth exalt himſelfe above all that is called God &amp; ſhewes himſelfe that he is God; <hi>2. Theſ. 2.4.</hi> and hath a mouth ſpeaking great things &amp; blaſphemies, &amp; is wondred at &amp; worſhipped throughout the world. <hi>Rev. 13.3.4.5.</hi> And when he is croſſed in any of his luſts then he makes warre with the Saints &amp; overcomes them &amp; is drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

with their blood. <hi>Rev. 13.7. &amp; 17.6.</hi> &amp; ſuffers them not to buy or ſell that will not receive his marke. <hi>Rev. 13.17.</hi> Hereby it appeares that the ſpirit of Antichriſt and the breath of his life is luſt: theſe worldly luſts are as it were the bridle and ſaddle wherewith Satan rides upon him: with the ſpurres of theſe luſts he drives him on to commit ſo great abhominations. By luſt is the greateſt ſinne wrought in the world; and therefore is every one to be warned hereby to fight continually againſt theſe luſts that fight againſt the ſoule and make it a ſlave to Satan. <hi>1. Pet. 2.11.</hi> They muſt either mortify theſe luſts of the old man, or els for ever be a ſpoyle &amp; prey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the old ſerpent that worketh by them.</p>

               <p>Holy Ghoſt, they are againe taught upon the new conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this honour done unto them, &amp; in reverence of this divine gueſt, to proceed unto a further degree &amp; care of their mortification, to cleanſe themſelves from all filthines of fleſh and ſpirit, to ſubdue the old man with his luſts &amp; affections, leſt they grieve this Spirit that is come to dwell with them. <hi>1. Cor. 6.19.20. 2. Cor. 6.16. &amp; 7.1. Eph. 4.30.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(a) The manner how the Spirit doth mortify ſinne is by bringing the ſinner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt &amp; by him unto the Father. As the Father for communicating of life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men hath ſent his Sonne to merit life, <hi>Ioh. 7.16. &amp; 3.16.</hi> &amp; both the Father &amp; the Sonne have ſent the Holy Spirit for our aſſurance of that life: <hi>Ioh. 15.26.</hi> ſo the Spirit againe bringes us both to Chriſt &amp; to the Father and firſt teacheth us to embrace Chriſt; he teſtifies of Chriſt and glorifies him &amp; takes of his &amp; ſhewes it unto us. <hi>Ioh. 16.13.14.15.</hi> The manner how the Spirit bringes us unto Chriſt is by working in us the graces of Faith, Hope &amp; Love of Chriſt. Theſe are the moſt ſweet breathings of the Holy Ghoſt: &amp; by each of theſe he workes mortification in them that are ſo brought unto him.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:14270:104"/>I. Faith in Chriſt ſerves to kill ſinne in us many wayes. Firſt of all by the death of Chriſt there is merited for us not onely the pardon of our ſinne, but alſo a power of ſubduing ſinne; by his death he hath merited the gift of the ſpirit, even of the ſpirit of ſanctification. Of this gift we are made partakers by faith, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffes us into Chriſt &amp; into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his death &amp; of all the merit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Therefore is it ſayd that we are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together with him into the likenes of his death; and hereupon we know that the old man is crucifyed with him, that the body of ſinne might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin. <hi>Rom. 6.5.6.7 8.</hi> Thus being by faith uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, the ſpirit of mortification as well as the gift of reconciliation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us: &amp; in this regard ſhould we the more earneſtly ſeek that precious faith which procures ſo great grace unto us. Therefore did Chriſt beare our ſins in his body on the tree, that we might become dead unto ſinnes; <hi>1. Pet. 2.24.</hi> that by the merit of his death ſinne might be mortifyed in us. And hereupon we come to ſay with the Apoſtle that we are crucifyed with Chriſt, <hi>Gal. 2.20.</hi>

               <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:14270:105"/>we may ſtand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made us free. <hi>Gal. 5.1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Moreover as our Mortification depends upon that which Chriſt merited for us; ſo that which Chriſt by his death obtained for himſelfe doth further lead us thereunto. For to this end Chriſt both dyed &amp; roſe againe, that he might be Lord both of the dead &amp; living. <hi>Rom. 14.9.</hi> And as we beleeve that he is becom our Lord, ſo we are to beleeve that we are become his ſervants, being bought with a price, to wit by his blood; &amp; therefore are not our owne but his, <hi>1. Cor. 6..19.20 &amp; 7.23.</hi> &amp; therefore may not doe our owne willes nor follow our owne affections &amp; luſts but are to mortify them that we may doe his will. Thus the faith of Chriſts domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us purchaſed by his death, doth ſerve for an help of our mortification, while it apprehends that the redeemed of Chriſt are redeemed from the earth, from among men to follow the Lambe, being the firſt fruits unto God &amp; to the Lambe. <hi>Rev. 14.3.4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Againe, being in part mortifyed &amp; contrite for ſinne, by another act of faith we doe further apprehend that in Chriſt we ſhall be accepted notwithſtanding the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14270:105"/>
weake meaſure of mortification that is in us. And this faith of acceptance is a great encouragement for us to proceed further in the ſubduing &amp; mortifying of the fleſh with the luſts thereof, &amp; to abound day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein, when as we know that our weake labour in the Lord is not in vaine; <hi>1. Cor. 15.58.</hi> when this perſwaſion abides within us, that the day of ſmall beginnings is not to be deſpiſed; <hi>Zech. 4.10.</hi> that the Lord doth both accept the willing minde notwithſtanding many wants, <hi>2. Cor. 8.12.</hi> &amp; will alſo in due ſeaſon perfect &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which he hath begun in us. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 1.6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(b) That we may the better appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the comfort of this acceptance through faith, there are divers poynts to be obſerved touching the nature of true Mortification which is yet acceptable to God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, that it is ſtill imperfect in this life even in the moſt excellent ſervants of Chriſt, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe themſelves wretched tranſgreſſours of the law of God, feeling in themſelves another law &amp; power of ſinne rebelling againſt the law of their minde, &amp; leading them into captivity to the law of ſinne that is in their members.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:14270:106"/>
                  <hi>Rom. 7.23.24.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, true mortification of ſinne as it is imperfect, ſo it is nnequall; every man having a portion of grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt. <hi>Eph. 4.7.</hi> The ſame meaſure of the ſpirit is not to be exſpected in all. All have not the ſame meaſure of ſorrow for their ſinnes that ſome others have; yet it may be true and unfained, and ſo accepted of God. The fruits of repentance are in ſome thirty, in ſome ſixty, in ſome an hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. <hi>Matt. 13.23.</hi> Though every true beleever have the ſpirit of God, <hi>Rom. 8.9.</hi> &amp; be a ſpirituall perſon; <hi>1. Cor. 2.14.15.</hi> yet ſome truely ſpirituall are ſo weake that in compariſon of others they are not ſpirituall. <hi>1. Cor. 3.1.</hi> And therefore ought not any for this to be diſcouraged if they finde themſelves inferiour unto others.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thirdly, true Mortification as it is unequall, ſo it is in ſome reſpects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the faithfull: as there are divers meaſures thereof, ſo are there divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of it. The gifts &amp; graces of God are not onely many but manifold or divers &amp; of different kinde in divers perſons: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. and therefore ſome that have not
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:14270:106"/>
mortifyed the outward actions of ſinne may have ſtriven more in the mortifying of their inward luſts &amp; affections. Some that have not mortifyed the more hainous ſinnes, but have ſometimes fallen into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſcandals, may yet in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of life farre exceed thoſe in true mortification which yet never fell into ſuch groſſe outward offences. <hi>1. Kin. 15.5. 2. Sam. 24.3.4. &amp;c.</hi> And ſome that proceed further unto dayly mortification of the actions of ſinne, may yet want that great contrition &amp; ſorrow for ſinne which is in others that fall oftner &amp; doe leſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from the ordinary practiſe of ſinne. It is hard for any to determine whether it was greater grace in Ioſeph a ſervant reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the temptation &amp; not committing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with his miſtreſſe; or in David after his fall to humble himſelfe ſo farre as being a glorious king to ſhame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by publick confeſſion of his adultery. <hi>Pſa. 51. title.</hi> For as God magnifies his mercy by ſinne in forgiving it, more then if no ſinne had bene: <hi>Rom. 3.4. &amp; 5.20.</hi> ſo the godly may ſometime manifeſt their grace and godlines by open and effectuall repentance, more then if that ſpeciall ſin had not bene committed by them. <hi>Luk.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14270:107"/>
7.38-34.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IIII. Fourthly, that Mortification which ariſeth from the livelieſt faith and feeling of Gods favour in Chriſt is moſt acceptable unto God; rather then that which hath the extreameſt griefe, feare and terrour joyned with it, or then that which hath a greater reſtraint of ſinfull actions. For as by faith men pleaſe God; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.<hi>5.6.</hi> ſo according to the meaſure of faith in any action men doe more or leſſe pleaſe God therein. Though the degrees of mortification be many; though the working of faith be ſometimes revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more at one degree then at another; yet whatſoever is wrought at any degree, is ſtill by faith; whether it be at the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the diſpoſition, the motion, affection, will, or action, or in contrition after the ſinfull action; whether it be in divers men according to their different meaſure of grace, or in the ſame men according to their divers aſſiſtance at ſeverall times, it is all by faith. Faith is the root of other graces. <hi>Col. 2.7.</hi> &amp; every act of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a branch ſpringing from this root; &amp; no branch may boaſt againſt the root that beareth it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18. This is the victory that overcommeth the world, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:14270:107"/>
our faith: 1. <hi>Ioh. 5.4.</hi> by it mortification is wrought; &amp; by it each act of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation becomes moſt acceptable to God. And therefore above all things we are to labour that this bleſſed grace of faith may be ſtirred up within us; that though it have as it were ſlept at one aſſault of ſin, it may yet be awakened at another degree of mortification in the progreſſe of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall combates. And ſeing the ſpirit of God is the ſpirit of faith, <hi>2. Cor. 4.13.</hi> therefore ſhould we ſeek to be filled with the ſpirit, <hi>Eph. 5.18.</hi> that by it we may both become ſtrong in the Lord &amp; in the power of his might, &amp; may withall in the middes of our weakeneſſes be comforted &amp; encouraged through this faith of being made acceptable unto God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>(c) Furthermore beſides this working of faith for the mortification of all kinde of ſin in generall, there is yet alſo a more particular conſideration of the power of faith for the mortification of ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes againſt God &amp; man. By faith the ſpirituall pride of nature is ſubdued, and confidence in a mans owne ſelfe is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne: whiles ſuch a way of ſalvation by free grace, without our owne works &amp; merits is taught us by faith. Thus is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14270:108"/>
&amp; utter denyall of a mans ſelf wrought in the ſoule, as the Spirit declareth by that threefold emphaticall interrogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the anſwer thereof, when as he ſaith, <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded. By what law? of vvorkes? Nay; but by the law of faith. Rom. 3.27.</hi> And ſo alſo in reſpect of men it may in like manner be dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Where is hatred &amp; revenge? it is excluded. By what law? of workes? Nay; but by the law of faith. Faith teacheth men to be kinde, mercifull, tender hearted, forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another and forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they beleeve the pardon of their owne ſinnes, and that God in Chriſt hath forgive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. <hi>Eph. 4.32. Col. 3.13.</hi> Though the law of workes require both humility in reſpect of God &amp; meekenes in reſpect of men, though it condemne both boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting &amp; revengefulnes; yet it is the law of faith that workes theſe graces required &amp; mortifyes the contrary ſinnes.</p>
               <p>(d) Having heard how the Spirit by faith bringes us unto Chriſt for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſinne, it followes that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the ſame is done by Hope alſo, through the aſſured exſpectation of the glory that is to come. Chriſt is our Hope &amp; the Hope of glory. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14270:108"/>
And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Hope there ariſeth a double act of mortification by two eſpeciall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sobriety &amp; Patience that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed therein.</p>
               <p>Sobriety is an act of mortification which conſiſts in the ſubduing of inordinate joy &amp; delight of all earthly pleaſures, honours and profits wherewith ſo many are as it were drunken &amp; overcome. By looking for that bleſſed Hope &amp; the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the great God &amp; our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, we are taught to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines &amp; worldly luſts, &amp; to live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and temperately in the moderate uſe of all outward comforts. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.13. The godly doe know that when the Lord ſhall appeare in glory they ſhall be made like unto him, when they ſhall ſee him as he is. And every one that hath this Hope in him purifyeth himſelfe as he is pure. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2.3. This purification of the ſoule from uncleane pleaſures and luſts is the mortification of them. As a greater light doth obſcure &amp; dimme the leſſe, &amp; both the ſtarres in the firmament &amp; the candles lighted on earth below doe ceaſe to ſhine when the light of the radiant Sunne doth ariſe upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: ſo all the brighteſt lampes of worldly pleaſure are as it were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

ſuffer with joy the ſpoyling of their goods knowing in themſelves that they have in heaven a better &amp; an enduring ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34.</p>
               <p>(e) After the conſideration of Faith &amp; Hope it remaines that we proceed to the third grace of Love, whereby the holy Spirit doth worke a further mortification in the elect. And firſt of all, by the love of Chriſt men are brought to the love of death, having a deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. This deſire of death cannot be in a man untill he be dead unto the world, &amp; untill the love of the things that are in the world be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved within him. Vntill a man be content to depart from all other vanities he cannot deſire to goe unto Chriſt. And therefore ought the godly to labour to finde in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this deſire of being tranſlated out of the world to be with Chriſt, that thereby they may finde more aſſurance of their mortification. We ſee how the tender &amp; fervent love of ſome friends makes them willing &amp; deſirous to die with their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds &amp; doth after a ſort mortifye the world unto them. Iacob having loſt Ioſeph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be comforted &amp; reſolved to goe downe mourning into the grave unto his

It is recorded by divers hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians touching the barbarous Indians in ſome parts both of the Eaſt &amp; the Weſt, &amp; ſome Black-Moores in Guinea in the midſt betwixt them both; that many of the ſubjects doe willingly die with their kings and many women with their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: that the Prince being drowned many of the people have willingly drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves with him: that ſome men give their wives, ſome their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſome their ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to be buried alive in the grave with their king, to ſerve him in another world: that ſome women doe cheerfully &amp; by the encouragement of their friends caſt themſelves into the fire, wherein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their manner of burial in ſome places, the dead bodies of their huſbands are conſumed together.

declared, it remaineth yet to be ſhewed how the Spirit having brought us to Chriſt doth bring us thereby to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father: for in Chriſt through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we have acceſſe or entrance to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. and are reconciled to God &amp; ſaved; and not onely ſo, but we alſo joy in God through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. And then all the attributes that are in God abſolutely conſidered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the other comforts to be had by them, doe in ſpeciall ſerve for our morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Spirit of Chriſt teaching us the right life of them. God is light: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.5. and all his glorious attributes are ſo many divine beames of light, whereof every one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſhining upon us doth further our mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The eye of Gods infinite wiſedome looking downe upon us may well ſtrike us with ſhame of our vaine behaviour and forgetfulnes of God, and make us mourne as Peter, when at his third denyall Chriſt turned and looked upon him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.61.62.

The ſight of Gods infinite power may well caſt us downe and make us ſeeme leſſe then graſhoppers in our owne eyes, when Iſraelites were ſo ſtricken with the ſight of the mighty and tall Anakims. <hi>Num.</hi> 13.33. His infinite goodnes &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy communicated with us ſhould affect us more then Davids did Mephiboſheth, &amp; cauſe us rather to ſay, What are we that the Lord ſhould looke upon ſuch dead dogs as we are? 2. <hi>Sam. 9.8.</hi> His infinite wrath againſt ſin, before which the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines quake and melt, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.5.6. may well ſtrike us with godly ſorrow for the ſame ſins which in the reprobate are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with unrecoverable deſtruction though they be pardoned in us.

               </argument>
               <p>THe Spirit of God working inwardly is the principall meanes of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; yet ordinarily he chooſeth thoſe times for this his work, when as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the outward meanes which he hath appoynted to this purpoſe. Theſe meanes are either the uſe of his ordinances, or the conſideration of his workes. The primary ordinances of God whereby the Spirit killes ſinne are his Word, Prayer, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:14270:112"/>
&amp; Diſcipline that he hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Theſe are the weapons of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, not carnall, but mighty through God to caſt downe ſtrong holds. <hi>2. Cor. 10.4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(a) His Word is the Hammer of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, that breakes the ſtony heart &amp; makes it contrite. <hi>Ier. 23.29.</hi> As he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is, ſo is his word, lively &amp; mighty in operation, &amp; ſharper then any two-edged ſword, that pierceth deep &amp; cuts the ſoule &amp; ſpirit, <hi>Heb. 4.12.13.</hi> and hewes the old man in pieces, as Samuel once hewed king Agag in pieces before the Lord. <hi>1. Sam. 15.33.</hi> This ſword of the Spirit is to be taken into the hands of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that would obtaine the victory over the world. <hi>Eph. 6.17.</hi> This word is to be heard publickely, to be read privately, to be meditated upon continually: &amp; out of it a ſtore of divine ſentences, commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, promiſes and threatnings is to be gathered &amp; kept in readines, <hi>Col. 3.16.</hi> &amp; according to every mans neceſſity and ſpeciall temptations ſo to be applyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes &amp; the pride of life, for the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Theſe divine teſtimonies &amp; words of God are like ſo many ſharp nayles, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.11. to be faſtened into the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:14270:112"/>
hands and feet of the old man, that ſo he may be crucifyed. As it was the honour of Iael, &amp; ſhe was bleſſed above women, becauſe ſhe put her hand to the nayle and her right hand ro the hammer, and ſmote Siſera and ſtroke through his temples till the enimy of Gods people was ſlayne: <hi>Iudg. 5.24.26.27.</hi> ſo ſhall they be bleſſed above other men and women that having furniſhed themſelves with ſtore of divine oracles, doe then put their hands to the nayles &amp; hammer of the Spirit, &amp; ſo ſtrike downe every luſt &amp; ſinful motion as ſoone as it beginnes to lift up the head and to ſtirre within them, by applying the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God againſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>By Prayer the ſpirit of mortification is obtained both when it is deſired by petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the precept &amp; promiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.41. as alſo by the very act &amp; exerciſe of prayer, though this grace in particular be not deſired but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; in as much as the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Gods preſence and the very preſenting of the ſoule before him doth ſtrike downe proud thoughts &amp; ſet the ſoule in a way of mortification. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 59.2-7.</p>
               <p>The Sacraments being due ly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14270:113"/>
and received ſerve alſo in ſpeciall manner to mortifye the old man. In Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme there is as it were a grave of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when being baptiſed into the death of Chriſt we are buryed with him by baptiſme. <hi>Rom. 6.3.4. Col. 2.12. 1. Cor. 15.29.</hi> The reverent and due meditation of this ordinance &amp; the beholding of the adminiſtration thereof is more effectuall for the mortifying of ſinne, then travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Ieruſalem to behold the ſepulcher of Chriſt, as many have done. In the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord the body and blood of Chriſt is ſo lively repreſented unto us, that with Thomas we doe put our fingers into the hands and ſide of Chriſt, into the print of the nayles &amp; ſpeare; <hi>Ioh. 20.27.</hi> &amp; in the due conſideration thereof we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but crucifye our owne fleſh with the affections and luſtes.</p>
               <p>In the exerciſe of Diſcipline, by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions &amp; rebukes for ſin the heart is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and broken; <hi>Pſal. 69.20. with Zech. 13.6.</hi> and the cenſures are adminiſtred for the deſtruction of the fleſh &amp; ſhaming of the offendour, <hi>1. Cor. 5.5. 2. Theſſ. 3.14.</hi> that by ſuch meanes he might be truely mortifyed. They ſerve alſo for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and humbling of the perſons by
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:14270:113"/>
whom they are adminiſtred, giving them juſt cauſe of mourning &amp; bewayling both their owne &amp; others miſeries by reaſon of ſinne: <hi>1. Cor. 3.2. 2. Cor. 7.8.</hi> and <hi>12.21.</hi> even as under the Law he that did that which tended to the cleanſing of others became uncleane himſelfe. <hi>Num. 19.7.</hi>8.10.21.</p>
               <p>(b) The ſecondary ordinances of God are ſuch meanes of mortification as ſerve to help &amp; further us in the uſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; as namely Faſting &amp; Watching, that we may be better prepared to pray, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, to heare the word, to receive the Sacraments, to performe other religious dueties. By faſting we underſtand either abſtinence from meat altogether, for a ſhorter time; as in David &amp; others, <hi>2. Sam. 1.12. &amp; 3.35.</hi> or abſtinence from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant meat for a longer time; as in Daniel, <hi>Dan. 10.2.3. vvith verſ. 11.12.13.</hi> The uſe of both is to humble the ſoule, that it may be better fitted for the exerciſe of mortification: to this end are we called thereunto of God, <hi>Ioel 2.12.</hi> and for the ſame purpoſe are the examples of the Saints that have bene frequent therein, commended unto us in Scripture. <hi>Dan. 9.3. Pſa. 35.13. &amp; 69.10. 2. Cor. 11.27. &amp;</hi>

either to caſt off their ſins or themſelves to be caſt out of the Church: they ſay in that covenant conditionally as Ionas ſayd when he offered himſelfe to be caſt into the ſea, <hi>Ion. 1.12.</hi> binding themſelves at their entrance into the Church either to beware of offences diſturbing the peace thereof, or to yeeld unto thoſe courſes whereby themſelves deſerve to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
               <p>(d) Having conſidered the ordinances of the New Teſtament &amp; the ſubordinate helpes whereby we are furthered in the exerciſe of mortification, let us now ſee what may be obſerved to this purpoſe from the ordinances of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Though the practiſe of them ceaſe in the ceremony, yet not the meditation of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the practiſe of thoſe dueties which are ſignifyed by the ceremonies. And all of them in ſpeciall manner preach mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto us and call us thereunto. The ordinary Sacraments of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were Circumciſion &amp; the Paſſeover. In circumciſion there was a painefull cutting off of the foreſkinne, &amp; a marke for the mortification of the fleſh printed in the body of man, for a perpetuall memoriall of this duety: ſo that the Holy Ghoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14270:114"/>
the phraſe of circumciſion doth oft deſcribe our mortification unto us, as <hi>Deu. 30.6. Ier. 4.3.4. Rom. 2.28.29. Col. 2.11.</hi> Godly ſorrow is a knife of mortification to circumciſe the heart, to cut off the foreſkin &amp; ſuperfluities of ſinfull luſts. In the paſſeover, the ſeparation of the lambe from the tenth day unto the fourteenth day, the killing of it &amp; ſprinkling of the blood, the roſting of it, &amp; eating it with ſowre herbes &amp; unleavened bread, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.4.6.7.8. &amp;c. did repreſent the deadlines of ſin purged in ſuch manner, even by the blood of Chriſt the undefiled lambe ſlaine for us, &amp; to be applyed unto us &amp; ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon us, to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſowre herbs of godly ſorrow for ſin, &amp; a purging out of the old leaven of maliciouſnes &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the old man &amp; his workes that we might be a new lump. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.8.</p>
               <p>That which the Sacraments repreſented unto them was in like manner ſignifyed by the Sacrifices of the old Teſtament; by laying handes upon the head of the beaſt that was ſlaine &amp; burnt for ſacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4.5. &amp;c. and theſe of many kindes &amp; in great number every day, upon divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and eſpecially upon their feaſt dayes, when many thouſands were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

ſprinkled him with water to make him cleane; <hi>Num. 19.14.21.22.</hi> but a dead beaſt did not defile all that came into the tent or ſtable where it was. IV. Not the carcaſſes of all beaſts, but onely of thoſe that were uncleane beaſts did defile men: not the carcaſſes of ſheep, oxen, goates, doves, harts, hindes, roes, &amp;c. but the carcaſſes of ſwine, camels, vultures, &amp;c. <hi>Lev. 11.</hi> but for men the carcaſſes of all men whoſoever, cleane or uncleane, good or bad, did defile all that touched them. <hi>Num. 19.11.</hi> V. The bodies of uncleane beaſts did not defile but onely when they were dead; otherwiſe it was lawfull to ride upon horſes, mules, camels and aſſes, as Chriſt did according to the propheſy: <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. <hi>with Matt.</hi> 21.2-7. but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of uncleane men, while they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving did defile other men many wayes; as we ſee in the lepers and ſuch as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with other naturall uncleanneſſes: <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.46. &amp; 15.5. &amp;c. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. To have touched a venomous toad had leſſe defiled then the touch of a moſt glorious king, or the touch of the faireſt woman, though but the hemme of their garments, &amp; without the leaſt motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or luſt of evill, when they were but ceremonially pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:14270:115"/>
VI. He that was defiled with the carcaſſe of an uncleane beaſt was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to waſh more then his clothes: but he that was defiled with the carcaſſe of a dead man or ſome other uncleane perſons was required to bathe himſelfe in water al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>Num. 19.19. Lev. 15.13.</hi> VII. Thoſe that touched the carcaſſes of uncleane beaſts were purged with common water: <hi>Lev. 11.25.28.</hi> thoſe that were defiled by touching of the dead were not to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but by water and blood; to wit, by a ſpeciall water of purification made with the aſhes of a red heifer. <hi>Num. 19.2-9.17.</hi> By all this it appeares how marvellous great the pollution of mans ſinne is, which God would have him ſo many wayes to be put in minde of, to avoyd the tent and company of wicked men, that by ſo many exerciſes of mortification he might learne to touch no uncleane thing. As David in deteſtation of himſelfe ſayd unto the Lord <hi>I vvas as a beaſt before thee: Pſal. 73.22.</hi> ſo we are here taught to conſider and confeſſe that we are worſe then beaſts, as it is alſo elſwhere noted for our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. <hi>Eſa. 1.3.

Men are warned of God to mortify ſin not onely by greater afflictions but even by the leſſer ſort alſo; for there are two kindes of them, a light touch &amp; a heavy hand. <hi>Eſa. 9.1.</hi> There is a wonderfull variety in Gods dealings this way: ſometimes the touch is ſo eaſy &amp; gentle that it is ſcarſe felt; men are ſcarſe able to ſay whether there be a paine in it or no; they have ſuch light aches of the head, the belly, the bones, ſuch ſmall reproches and loſſes that they are hardly ſenſible of them. As a loving motherſmites her child ſometimes ſo ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; gently, that it doth not appeare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe be angry or not; even ſo doth our moſt loving God deale oftentimes with his children; <hi>Iob 33.14.15. with ch. 7.14.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Touching Vivification or quickening of the new man.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The nature &amp; neceſſity thereof in generall. (a) Six degrees of vivification: 1. A new diſpoſition or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of quickening grace; 2. Motions of ſpirituall life in the underſtanding, judgment &amp; memory. 3. Affections of love, joy, deſire &amp;c. 4. Renewing of the will; 5. Workes of righteouſnes &amp; true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines; 6. Ioyful thankſgiving in the apprehenſion of all the former graces of life. (b) The inward meanes of vivification: The Spirit of God bringing us unto Chriſt &amp; working in us the graces of Faith, Hope &amp; Love. (c) The outward meanes: The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ordinances; the Word, Prayer, Sacraments &amp; Diſcipline; (d) The ſecondary; a holy Feaſt and a holy Watch; (e) Ordinances of a third degree, Vowes and Covenants. (f) The workes of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Providence.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom the Mortification of the old man come we now to the Vivification of the new man. It is not poſſible that theſe two can be ſevered: if any man be in Chriſt he muſt be a new creature, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. borne againe of the Spirit, &amp; by this new birth made partaker of a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life. <hi>Ioh. 3.3.5.</hi> The Lord that is rich in mercy through his great love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loveth his elect, quickeneth them
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14270:120"/>
together in Chriſt. <hi>Eph. 2.4.5.</hi> The feeling of this new life is a preparative unto death and a preſervative againſt all the terrours thereof, and leads men with comfort through the gates of death, overcomes the pangs thereof, ferries &amp; conveyes men over all the floods of ſorrowes.</p>
               <p>(a) This grace of Vivification is to be conſidered in ſix eſpeciall degrees, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe ſix degrees of Mortification before noted, &amp; each of them may better be underſtood when they are mutually compared together.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt degree of Vivification is a new diſpoſition or habit of quickening grace infuſed by the Spirit of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are inclined to imbrace Chriſt, to glory in his merit &amp; to live unto him. This new diſpoſition is like a new borne babe, or at leaſt as a babe newly conceived in the wombe of the ſoule, &amp; is called the new creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. the new man, <hi>Eph. 4.24.</hi> the inward man, <hi>Rom 7.22.</hi> the law of their minde, <hi>verſ. 23.</hi> the newnes of ſpirit: <hi>verſ. 6.</hi> &amp; the conſideration of this gift is cauſe of great joy &amp; thankesgiving unto the faithfull, that doe therefore break out into the praiſe of God and bleſſe him that hath begotten them againe. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14270:120"/>
As it is matter of joy unto a mother to have a living childe borne, though for that preſent it lie bound in ſwadling clothes without ſtirring hand or foot; ſo it is great joy unto the regenerate to have this new habit of life, though they doe not alwayes feele it actually ſtirring within them. Yea this is a comfort that ſupporteth the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the midſt of manifold temptations, when notwithſtanding their great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections &amp; preſent impotency unto good, they yet can remember this habit of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life formerly diſcerned in themſelves by ſundry joyfull apprehenſions &amp; fruits of faith in time paſt. This is that ſeed of God which remaineth &amp; abideth ever in thoſe hearts where it is once ſowne. 1. <hi>Ioh. 3.9.</hi> This is that heavenly drop of divine grace which being once diſtilled into the ſoule is never dryed up, but becomes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of living water ſpringing up into everlaſting life, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.14. This is that precious ſpark of ſpirituall life, which though it be ſometimes raked under the aſhes of worldly cares and feares, yet is it never extinguiſhed, but upon occaſion breakes forth &amp; burnes more bright then before.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A ſecond degree of vivification of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14270:121"/>
the new man conſiſteth in the motions of new life and in the ſtirrings of the ſpirit, which are a further comfort &amp; demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirituall life. As the mother that hath conceived in her wombe &amp; yet for a long time together feeles not her childe to ſtirre within her, doth then begin to feare and to doubt of the life thereof: ſo the godly having bene long without the lively motions of the ſpirit beginne to feare ſometimes and to doubt of their eſtate. But upon the new motions of the ſpirit they are filled with comfort, &amp; thereby feele their ſweet babe, the new creature as it were to ſpring in their wombe againe. Theſe motions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpirations whereby the minde is illuminate to diſcerne and know the will of God, to give aſſent and approbation unto it when it is knowne and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it alſo when it is approoved <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17.18, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9. Without theſe gracious operations of the ſpirit many having the truth propounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them doe not apprehend it; others apprehending the meaning thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove not of it; others approoving of it doe yet forget the ſame, and ſo it vaniſheth and is loſt. As the Spirit of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:14270:121"/>
God is ſayd to moove Samſon at certaine times and to ring in his eare like a bell, as the originall word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: <hi>Iud.</hi> 13.25. <hi>with Exod.</hi> 28.33.34.35. ſo theſe motions and impulſions of the ſpirit in the godly are as the ſound of an heavenly bell ringing them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peales of conſolation and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their warning night &amp; day. Theſe are the counſels of God and whiſperings of the H. Spirit, like divine cymbals and high ſounding cymbals tinckling and rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the eares of the regenerate; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.7 and 51.6. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.21. for which they give thankes to God that illuminateth &amp; wakeneth their dead &amp; dark hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, when as of themſelves they are not ſufficient to conceive or think any thing that is good &amp; holy. <hi>2. Cor. 3.5. Pro. 30.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.3.</hi> As wicked motions are the meſſengers of Satan to buffet us; ſo theſe are the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God to quicken us, &amp; therefore as welcome gueſts are to be welcomed &amp; entertained with all thankfulnes.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Beſides the motions of ſpirituall life in the underſtanding, judgement and memory, there is a third degree of vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be obſerved, when as this life is further ſpread abroad into the affections.

worſhip and care for the poore Saints, harmleſſe life and innocency in reſpect of all men and bowels of compaſſion towards them in neceſſity. <hi>Eſa. 5.2.4.7.</hi> Hereby men ſhew that they are not ſtrangers from the life of God; but being rich in good workes, the workes of ſpirituall life, they doe hereby lay up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the time to come that they may lay hold on eternall life. <hi>1. Tim. 6.18.19.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Laſtly, it is a further manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirituall life when after the former degrees of vivification the new creature beholding this grace of God in it ſelfe doth with all joyfull thankſgiving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually. As David &amp; his people conſidering how God had opened their hearts &amp; quickened them to his ſervice rejoyced with great joy becauſe they had offered willingly, &amp; prayſed God becauſe he had mooved them to praiſe him: 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.9.10.13.14.17.20. ſo the regenerate that are borne of God can rejoyce in the Lord &amp; doe know the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhout; they doe therefore againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce becauſe they rejoyce. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15.16. And as one Rainebow by the reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth often beget another, &amp; that other
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:14270:122"/>
ſometimes begets a third, ſo that three Rainebowes have ſometimes appeared at once: ſo in the new creature one joy begets another, &amp; one light begets another, and one grace is the ſeed of another, <hi>Rom. 5.4.5.</hi> When Paul ſaw the conſtancy of the Theſſalonians it quickened him; when he ſaw their faith &amp; joy in the holy Ghoſt, it made him give thankes for them and to conceive great joy; 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.2.3.6. and when he conſidered the comfort of his owne joy for them, it made him give new thankes againe unto God for that joy. 1. <hi>Theſ. 3.8.9.</hi> And thus is ſpirituall life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated &amp; multiplyed in the faithfull whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as both by the ſenſe of quickening grace in themſelves, <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.12. &amp; by the ſight of it in others, they take new occaſion of glorifying God for his unſpeakable gift. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.12-15.</p>
               <p>(b) The meanes whereby this grace of vivification is wrought in the elect, is principally the Spirit of God which quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth and giveth life. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10.11. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. By it we are brought unto Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.14.15. &amp; 15.26. &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming unto him as unto a living ſtone we alſo are made living ſtones, full of life. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4.5. We come unto him when we

quicken us further by applying unto us the merit of his ſufferings. Then as the childe neeſed ſeven times, ſo the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the converted ſoule doth manifeſt the truth of life received by ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; at the firſt neeſing a new diſpoſition appeares; at the ſecond new motions; at the third new affections; at the fourth new will &amp; purpoſe; at the fift new fruits and workes; at the ſixt new thankeſgiving and praiſe in joy of the holy Ghoſt &amp; ſo much in this life: at the ſeventh neeſing the old man is utterly aboliſhed, the fleſh ſhaken quite off, and the ſpirit caryed into a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly kingdome, clothed with a white robe of perfect righteouſnes in Chriſt the fulneſſe of ſpirituall life. Therefore all is to be ſought principally in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>(c) The outward meanes whereby the Spirit quickeneth, are the ordinances and workes of God. The primary ordinances of God are his Word, Prayer, Sacraments and Diſcipline. The word of God is the word of life, <hi>Deut. 32.47. Ioh. 5.25. &amp; 6.63.68. Act. 5.20.</hi> a tree of life, <hi>Prov. 3.18.</hi> the immortall ſeed, <hi>1.

Ioh. 5.16.</hi> Baptiſme ſhewes us the laver of regeneration or new birth; <hi>Act. 2.38. with Tit. 3.5.

By the Table of the Lord the fainting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are relieved &amp; revived, through that ſpirituall food which is there exhibited. <hi>1. Cor. 11.24.</hi> The admonitious of Diſcipline are the corrections of life, <hi>Prov. 15.31.</hi> &amp; therein is conſolation for thoſe that are ready to be ſwallowed up of ſorrw. <hi>2.

God a bullock, a ramme, a lamb or goat, male or female, more or leſſe; inſomuch that the ſacrifices are ſometimes called by the name of vowes; &amp; the Lord accepted that vow of ſo ſmall a matter. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.38. <hi>Num.</hi> 15.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.39. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 116.12-19. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>with Act.</hi> 5.2.3. <hi>&amp; ch.</hi> 21.23.24.26.

of this way &amp; application of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer truth, the Lord hath in his word gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven further light and direction by certaine peculiar workes which himſelfe hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a happy end is worthy a ſpeciall prayer every day for that particular benefit. The maine bleſſing that Paul could wiſh unto Oneſiphorus that had ſo oft refreſhed him, was this, that the Lord would grant unto him that he might finde mercy of the

Lord in that day, <hi>2. Tim. 1.18.</hi> And this he prayes for the Theſſalonians, that their hearts might be ſtabliſhed unblameable in holines before God, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Father, at the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt with his Saints. <hi>1.

If David prayed ſo often and ſo earneſtly that he might enjoy the preſence of God in his earthly ſanctuary, to behold the beauty of his ordinances there; <hi>Pſa. 27.4. and 42.1.2. &amp; 84.1. &amp;c.</hi> how much more ought we to pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for our entrance into his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſanctuary, to enjoy the glory that

               <p n="3">III. As there is a needfull Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo there is a holy &amp; zealous Revenge neceſſary to be ſought before death, that men may die with more comfort. Neither let it ſeeme ſtrange that ſeeking of reve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſhould be reckoned among the ſpeciall preparatives unto death.

Moſes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his death is commanded to avenge the children of Iſrael of the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,

that then he might be gathered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people. <hi>Num. 31.1.2.</hi> One of his laſt workes was to be a work of revenge: that being done he was to die with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The remembrance of that revenge wrought by Phinehas could not but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him at his laſt houre. <hi>Num.</hi> 25.11.12.13. Saul therefore had extreme anguiſh &amp; diſcomfort in death, for not executing a revenge upon Amalek; as it was told him of the Devill, becauſe he would not learne it of God. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15-20. <hi>with ch.</hi> 15.1-35.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kingdome of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was opened after the aſcenſion of Chriſt &amp; the Spirit powred out &amp; many converted &amp; ſpiritual joy abounded, the comfort thereof produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced extraordinary fruits of love, as when Ioſes or Barnabas &amp; others that had la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds &amp; houſes ſold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; diſtributed to the poore <hi>Act. 4.34-37.</hi> ſuch gifts could not be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> every day; yet though it were done but o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in their life, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort thereof might well laſt ſo long as they lived. Zacheus that in the day of his joyfull converſion &amp; calling ſtood forth &amp; gave at once the half of his goods to the poore, though he could not every week make ſuch diſtributions; yet the comfort of that one act approoved &amp; accepted of Chriſt as a fruit of his faith &amp; token of his ſalvation could not but be a perpetuall conſolation to be thought on even to death. For earthly bleſſings recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſpeciall offerings were to be made at ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne times appointed of God: ſuch were

the feaſt in Abib, of the firſt fruits of barly harveſt, the feaſt of weeks, of the firſt fruits of wheat harveſt, &amp; the feaſt of tabernacles or of gathering in the fruits of the land in the end of the yeare: <hi>Exo. 23.16. &amp; 34.22. Lev. 23.</hi> to teach us that new bleſſings call for new expreſſions of thankfulnes, that we may honour God with our ſubſtance and with the firſt fruits of all our increaſe. <hi>Prov. 3.9.</hi> And as upon occaſion of ſpeciall comforts we are to be mooved unto the workes of mercy, ſo alſo at the conſideration of the ſpeciall afflictions and wants of others. In the time after the captivity, when the neceſſity was great and the bondage heavy upon the Iewes, then did godly Nehemias forbeare to take the bread of the Governour, the ſtipend of former rulers, and ſhewed extraordinary love &amp; compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in which he comforts himſelfe, praying the Lord to think upon him for good according to all the kindnes that he had done for his people. <hi>Nehem. 5.14-18.19.</hi> When with extreme need there appeare in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lively tokens of faith and godlines, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſpecially ſhould take place the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Iohn Baptiſt, that we ſhould abridge ourſelves of our food &amp; rayme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

ſee others want. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.10.11. Such good workes cannot but follow the godly to the grave and miniſter comfort at the laſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.36.39. It is a ſhame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the diſciples of Chriſt that ſo many and great purgatory-gifts have proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the falſe faith of merit-mongers; when the faith of his moſt glorious Goſpel doth not work the like in true beleevers: a ſhame that an idle dreame &amp; ſervile feare of imagined purgatory ſhould doe more then the aſſured and certaine perſuaſion of the love of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. With the work of mercy is to be joyned the work of humility &amp; meeknes, as a ſpeciall preparative for a comfortable death &amp; tranſlation out of this world. For as with thoſe that are tranſlated out of this world into heaven there is no reſpect of perſons; poore Lazarus is carried firſt in the boſome of an Angell, and then in the boſome of Abraham the Father of the faithfull: <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22. ſo thoſe that would beginne a heavenly life here &amp; in the end with comfort be tranſlated, are in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to make themſelves equall with them of lower eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. to converſe with the poore, to cary them in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; not onely to give a few pence of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14270:128"/>
ſilver, but to powre out their heart and their love unto them. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.10. This was propheſyed of as a fruit of Chriſts kingdome; <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11.6.7.8. &amp; ſuch corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the poore Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto us with promiſe of a large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.12.13.14. We are to walk by faith &amp; not by ſight: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. now by faith we ſee the Angels miniſtring unto them who ſhall be heires of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. l. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. &amp; therefore if we performe the like offices of love &amp; reſpect unto the poore ſervants of Chriſt we ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be fitter to goe with comfort into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Angels. They that thus goe out of the world beforehand by leaving the faſhions thereof &amp; become childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe, ſhall have a more comfortable entrance into the kingdome of heaven. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.3. As new borne babes here on earth are firſt taken up by one &amp; then by another, &amp; are delivered from one friends armes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one ſtriving to have them in their armes to kiſſe them: ſo the ſouls that are borne into heaven, are tranſlated by death firſt into the boſome of Angels ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then into the boſome of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham &amp; the Saints receiving them, every one imbracing them with kiſſes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:14270:129"/>
love, &amp; above all into the boſome of the Lord of glory, there to be ſatisfyed with his love in fulneſſe of joy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <hi>Eſa. 40.11. Pſal. 16. l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Another work whereby men are prepared to die with comfort is the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſick &amp; others that are in miſery. For the promiſe is that he that conſiders the poore or viſits the afflicted ſhall him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be preſerved and delivered in time of trouble: the Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing; he wil make all his bed in his ſicknes. <hi>Pſal. 41.1.2.3.</hi> By viſiting the ſick men both miniſter comfort unto others &amp; receive comfort themſelves. Firſt they give comfort and miniſter a bleſſing unto thoſe that are in diſtreſſe. Thus to viſit the fatherleſſe &amp; the widowes in their affliction is pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; undefiled before God and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Iam. 1.27.</hi> Oneſiphorus is comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for this, &amp; Paul prayes heartily for him, becauſe he ſought him out when he was in priſon, refreſhed him &amp; miniſtred many things unto him. <hi>2. Tim. 1.16.17.18.</hi> Iob noteth the excellency of this whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he joineth him that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with a king, even in the army, when he uſeth greateſt authority. <hi>Iob 29.25.</hi>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:14270:129"/>
Whatſoever is done unto the leaſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt in this kinde, he takes it as done unto himſelf; &amp; therefore ſuch ſhall be remembred &amp; honoured by him at the laſt day. <hi>Matt. 25.34-40.</hi> Secondly by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting thoſe that ſtand in need of comfort men doe alſo receive inſtruction &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto themſelves. <hi>Eccl. 7.2.3.4. 2. Kin. 13.14.15. &amp;c.</hi> Though we may not inquire at the dead, <hi>Deut. 18.11.</hi> yet at the dying we may learne many wholeſome leſſons, as of repentance from their complaints of their ſins bewailed, of faith from their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profeſſions of their hope &amp; the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their conſtancy, and of our owne mortality &amp; frailety from their ſtrength languiſhing, their pale countenances, their dimme eyes, their faltering tongue, their ratling throat, their panting heart, their ſhort breaths, their painfull convulſions, the laſt pangs &amp; ſneckes of death; all the ſymptomes of death are ſo many warnings unto the living to watch and prepare for their end. Whoſoever would be well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death, let them often repaire to ſuch mourning houſes, let them ſo viſit others in theſe caſes that withall they ſee &amp; learne themſelves that which God doth there ſo plainely teach them. That which

Elias ſayd unto Eliſha, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had prayed for a double portion of his ſpirit, <hi>If thou ſee me when I am taken from thee it ſhall be ſo unto thee: 2. Kin. 2.9.10.</hi> may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in another reſpect be ſayd unto us, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeing others taken away, that very act with the circumſtances of their departure is a meanes to increaſe the ſpirit in us, yea to double our care &amp; comfort in looking for our end.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, it is alſo a work prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory unto death to have our teſtament &amp; Wil in readines, that we need not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled therewith at laſt. When the meſſage of death was ſent unto Hezekias, he was called upon to ſet his houſe in order. <hi>Eſa. 38.1.</hi> Abraham was carefull to ſettle the affaires of his houſe and family before his death, as appeares by his diſpoſing of Iſaak in marriage, <hi>Gen. 24.1.2. &amp;c.</hi> &amp; his giving gifts to the ſonnes of Keturah his ſecond wife &amp; ſending them away. <hi>Gen. 25.6.</hi> But the cheef part of teſtaments &amp; legacies are godly exhortations, charges and bleſſings which parents give unto their children. This was Iſaaks care long before his death though he forgot the oracle that had aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bleſſing unto the younger. <hi>Gen. 27.1-4.</hi> Iſaak was then an hundred yeares old,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:14270:130"/>
                  <hi>Gen. 25.26. with ch. 26.34.</hi> &amp; he lived in all an hundred &amp; fourſcore yeares, <hi>Gen. 35.28.</hi> ſo that his teſtament, his bleſſing was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foureſcore yeares before he dyed. Iacob gave ſpeciall charges &amp; bleſſings unto his ſonnes before he died. <hi>Gen. 47.29. &amp; 48. &amp; 49. ch.</hi> Thus did Moſes with the children of Iſrael: <hi>Deut. 33.1. &amp;c.</hi> and Ioſhua: <hi>Ioſh. 23. &amp; 24. ch.</hi> Thus David alſo in a ſolemne aſſembly exhorteth the people &amp; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his ſonne Solomon to feare the Lord, &amp; encourageth him unto the work that was to be done after him. <hi>1. Chron. 28.1.8.9.10.</hi> Solomon had alſo received inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his mother to the ſame purpoſe, which he himſelf hath recorded, <hi>Prov. 31. ch.</hi> In ſpeciall the more to affect children &amp; friends by exhortations, promiſes and comforts, I would commend unto fathers &amp; friends the example of Elijah the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who in his life time made a writing which he procured to be delivered unto Iehoram after his death: <hi>2. Chron. 21.12-15. with 2. King. 3.11.</hi> thus there may ſtill be a propheſying after death, though not by way of foretelling things to come, yet by charges, admonitions &amp; conſolations, which being left with executours or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friends together with other deviſes

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered to prevent a double danger, both of ſome that ſeeme not to feare death &amp; of others that confeſſe they feare it. The firſt ſort are thoſe that deſpiſe their life &amp; caſt it away without being calld of God. Theſe deny the Lordſhip of Chriſt, becauſe that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:14270:131"/>
as no man ſhould live to himſelf, ſo none ſhould die to himſelf but to the Lord, that whether we live or die we may be the Lords. <hi>Rom. 14.7.8.9.</hi> This murder of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſelf is a grievous ſin, of which are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not onely ſuch as lay violent hands on themſelves, but even thoſe alſo that raſhly expoſe themſelves to unneceſſary dangers; combatants, raſh adventurers, ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a calling or any neceſſity goe to infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious places, which are as the ſhadow of death. As ſouldiers ſet to keep watch may not leave their ſtation till the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their Captaine: no more may we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to depart hence untill we be diſmiſſed or called away of our Commander. Every man is bound to preſerve life ſo long as by good meanes he can doe it, or els he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the ſixth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

               <p>(b) Secondly this poynt of doctrine touching the feare of death is wiſely to be conſidered in reſpect of many weake and infirme perſons, which have true faith, hope &amp; love, and yet are not ſo ready to

that though for their owne part they have an unfained deſire to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet for the good of others they are content &amp; deſirous to live, as a parent for his childrens education, a Prince for the reformation &amp; a Miniſter for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people in dangerous times. Thus it was with Hezekiah, <hi>Eſa. 38.18.19.</hi> &amp; Paul. <hi>Phill. 1.21-24.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(d) And yet even in all theſe diſtreſſes, when death approcheth &amp; God calles me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, there is comfort againſt every want: Chriſt makes ſupply of all; if there be any blemiſh, ſore or deformity, he is ſuch a bridegroome as ſuddenly heales all and preſents us to himſelf without ſpot or wrinckle or any ſuch thing: <hi>Eph. 5.27.</hi> He is the father of the fatherleſſe, the great Shepheard of the ſheep: <hi>Heb. 13.20.</hi> he will gather, feed &amp; defend his flock, he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſpirit whereby to fulfill all his good pleaſure, he is all in all. Hezekias had great deſire to live to ſee his children &amp; to teach them: and yet behold when God had prolonged his life &amp; added unto his dayes fifteen yeares, preſently he offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds &amp; heares a woeful threatning of judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>Eſa. 39.6.7.</hi> Yea Manaſſes his ſonne whom he got three yeares after his recovery, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:14270:133"/>
who entred into the kingdome when he was twelve yeares old, Hezekias his fiftee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares being expired, became a moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolater, murderer, witch, &amp;c. <hi>2. Kin. 21.1.2 &amp;c.</hi> Had Hezekias knowne ſo much whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he deſird to live lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to teach his children, it is not likely that he would have bene ſo deſirous of life. Therefore if God call us away we muſt be content to depart, whatſoever inconveniences be in the way: &amp; conſider how great a fault &amp; ſin it is to be unwilling to goe at his call.</p>
               <p>(e) To this end it will be profitable to think often of the greateſt hindrances and encumbrances in death, yea to conſider of them as if we were now upon our death-bed &amp; lay preſently a dying &amp; gaſping for breath; that we may learne to arme our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt all lets &amp; difficulties that make men unwilling to leave this world. For example:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I. Some are happily loth to leave the world becauſe of their friends, kinred, children, acquaintance &amp;c. whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they ſtill deſire to enjoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For one friend whom we leave here we finde a thouſand in heaven. For I. Of men in this world we ſee but one, as it were, our owne generation; and of this
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:14270:133"/>
generation not the thouſandth perſon: we never ſaw all the countries of the world, ſcarce heard of them, much leſſe their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, townes, particular perſons. II. Of thoſe we have ſeen we know not one city, much leſſe are we acquainted with all the inhabitants; there are many from whom we receive no love nor any fruits of love, yea ſome that proove our enimies &amp; from whom much evill is received. III. For that ſmall number of thoſe that are our true friends indeed, how weake are they in compariſon? not ſo amiable in ſoule or body by an hundred degrees as thoſe to whom we goe. IV. If men on earth were as gracious, vertuous &amp; unblameable as in heaven; yet in this earthly condition our communion with them is moſt imperfect defective &amp; lame, in reſpect of preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities layd upon us, as 1. Our droſſy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby we are like ſnailes &amp; cannot travell about the world in ſuch ſwift and glorious motions as in heaven. 2. Our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trades and vocations binding men like priſoners to ſit the whole week at their work, &amp; confining them to their ſeverall imployments. The world is like a <hi>Raſp-houſe</hi> or <hi>Bridewell,</hi> where by the rod of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity men are made to work; the twigs
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:14270:134"/>
or cords of this whip are hunger, thirſt, cold &amp; nakednes; the ſmart and ſhame of theſe doth ſcourge &amp; force men to labour: thus it is with men here in reſpect of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where there is no hindrance from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall making of acquaintance. 3. Our wearines &amp; ſleepy nature making us ſpend our nights in the ſhadow of death, as dead men; whereas in heaven there is no night, no ſhadow of the earth, which reacheth little further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſphere of the Moone; and therefore is farre from cauſing any darknes in the third heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in the paradiſe of God. What darknes or night can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch thither, where al the righteous ſhine as the Sun for ever? <hi>Matt. 13.43.</hi> 4. The weaknes of our ſenſes &amp; bodily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas here two ſoules ſitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not impart their mindes to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the outward organs &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſenſe; there the ſpirits without the body are like angels, goe without feet, embrace without hands, ſee without eyes, heare without eares, &amp; ſpeak without ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, for al theſe we leave in the grave. But above all friends, we then ſee God face to face, whom here we could not behold: <hi>Exod. 33.20.</hi> here we are as in a dungeon, then we begin to looke about us. Is there
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:14270:134"/>
any loſſe in this change?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. II.</hi> Others are troubled to thinke that they muſt leave houſe &amp; lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He that teacheth bees to make ſuch cabines &amp; cloſets for themſelves, will not ſuffer his owne children to be deſtitute of comfortable manſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: nay the Lord hath promiſed &amp; they know it to be ſo, that glorious pavilions &amp; chambers are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them. <hi>Ioh. 14.1.2. 2. Cor. 5.1</hi> Every heart ſhall then be a pavilion &amp; chamber of reſt &amp; delight unto each other: yea the Lord himſelfe ſhalbe their houſe &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ever, <hi>1. Ioh. 4.15.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> III. Another ſayth happily, I care not ſo much for any outward things, as to ſee the good of Gods Church in the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his promiſes. Among theſe there are three ſpecial things which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might wel deſire above all other things to be ſeen &amp; enjoyed in this world: viz. 1. The fall of Babylon &amp; deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; <hi>Rev. 18.20.</hi> 2. The deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gog &amp; Magog, the Turkiſh monarchy; 3. The full converſion of the Iewes, as a new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem comming downe from heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a bride trimmed for her huſband. It may wel be counted a happines to waite and come unto the ſight of ſuch dayes. <hi>Dan. 12.12.</hi>

                  <hi>1. Cor. 15.56.57.</hi> II. The freenes of Gods grace unto infants is applyed by the H. Ghoſt unto men of yeares, that they alſo may depend on the ſame grace through faith. <hi>Rom. 9.11.16.30.</hi> III. Many are called at the eleventh houre, and God doth by ſuch meanes greatly ſet forth the freenes of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in pardoning ſinners. <hi>Matth. 20.6-9. Rom. 5.20.</hi> The ſight of Chriſt by faith gives title unto all comfort &amp; happines. <hi>Luk. 2.30-32.</hi> And therefore the theef on the croſſe ſeeing Chriſt at laſt, was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated into glory. <hi>Luk. 23.43.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any ſay, That is but one example; for in effect there are many very like unto that even in the converſion of many thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in priſon, in the hands of juſtice, yea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have received the ſentence of death; when they die better &amp; give more ſignes of true repentance then multitudes that die in their beds. And beſides, every mans converſion is in a certaine houre or moment, ſuddainly as well as the theefes on the croſſe, though it be not marked: and it is as great a work &amp; the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to be tranſlated out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace by true converſion, as to be tranſlated out of this
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:14270:135"/>
world into heaven, the one following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly upon the other. So Pauls ſuddaine converſion from a blaſphemous perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of Chriſt to be a member and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, was as great as the theefes tranſlation from the croſſe or gibbet to paradiſe, or rather greater. The ſame may be ſayd of thoſe thouſands of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Chriſt, ſuddainly converted at Peters ſermon: <hi>Act. 2.</hi> the converſion of each of theſe was as great as that of the theef, and may as well ſerve for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſinners. Chriſt is the doore: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever knockes by faith &amp; whenſoever, is ſure to enter.</p>

God. Our Samſon teares this Lyon as a kid, deſtroyes death, &amp; out of the carcaſſe of death brings life, honye &amp; hony combes of eternall comfort. Let us therefore be cheerfull in the exſpectation of this happy conqueſt, &amp; with comfort entertayne the ſignes of death drawing neere unto us, as dimnes of ſight, deafnes of eares, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of limmes, whitenes of head &amp; hoare haires: Oh how welcome ſhould theſe &amp; the like be unto the faithfull? As the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in our ſtreets, when they firſt ſee the ſtork, the meſſenger of the Spring, doe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come theſame &amp; teſtify their pleaſure with manifold &amp; joyful acclamations: ſo ſhould the godly congratulate themſelves when they ſee the forenamed meſſengers of their Winter paſt &amp; Summer approching; or els both children and the very ſtorkes in the aire, knowing the times of their comming, ſhalbe witneſſes againſt us. When the fig-tree putteth forth his leaves the Summer is nigh: <hi>Matt. 24.32.</hi> when the almond-tree flouriſhes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it haſtens the comming of other fruits: <hi>Eccl. 12.5. Ier. 1.11.12.</hi> when the heralds of death approch; then is it time for us to lift up our heads, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that our redemption is neere. When the eyes of the body, the windowes of our
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:14270:136"/>
proſpect into the world beginne to be dark, then muſt we ſo much the more open the eyes of our minde, the windowes of the ſoule for our proſpect into heaven, to ſee things otherwiſe inviſible. When the daughters of ſinging are abaſed, then eſpecially we ſhould labour to open the eares of faith that we may heare afarre off the ſongs of the virgines that have the harpes of God, ready to entertayne us into the fellowſhip of their ſweet melodies. When the grinders are flow &amp; beginne to ceaſe, let us then be more frequent in grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the wheat of heaven, chewing the cudde &amp; ruminating the manna of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall promiſes: that ſhould be the old mans milk &amp; the old mans wine, ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that of the muſcadell grape, to warme his cold breaſt &amp; to revive his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed ſpirits. Having thus entertained the meſſengers of death, we ſhalbe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to welcome death it ſelfe. The nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer we grow to our journeys end, the greater will be our deſire and longing to arrive at that Rendevous of friends after a long march, that generall meeting-place after a weariſome vvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring over hilles and dales in this our pilgrimage. As the diligent huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

plowes &amp; harrowes, ſowes his ſeed &amp; waites for the firſt &amp; latter raine, is glad when it begins to grow, when the blade, the ſtalk, the eare appeares, &amp; gladder whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ful growne, when the regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are white unto the harveſt, when ſithe &amp; ſickle are taken into the hand; but is then eſpecially filled with joy when the laſt load of corne is brought home with ſhouring &amp; ſinging, like to the cuſtome that ſeemes to have bene in Iſrael in their harveſt &amp; vintage: <hi>Eſa. 16.9.10.</hi> ſo in like manner they that have broken up their fallow ground, have ſowed in righteouſnes, have not been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in well doing, but ſtedfaſt &amp; unmoovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, ſhall then know &amp; ſee that their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hath not been in vaine in the Lord, ſhall then have cauſe to ſhout &amp; ſing for joy, when the Angels, that are called rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>Matt. 13.39.</hi> ſhall gather theſe wheat ſheaves into the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly barne, where the righteous ſhall ſhine foorth as the Sun in the kingdome of their Father. O that we were wiſe, that we underſtood this; ſo ſhould we ever with comfort remember our latter END.</p>
